ok, lets list some of the pillars of communist propaganda:

* exploitative nature of the capitalist system, where the rich few *exploit* the numerous poor
* hence, class warfare and the need to raise taxes on the rich (point 2. from commie manifesto)
* militaristic *imperialism* inherent in capitalism, embodied by american imperialism
* inherent racism in the american society
* the evil and reactionary fascist zionists movement (yes, USSR was somewhat into the blame the jew game)
* christianity is a backwards tradition stemming from the dark ages, opium of the masses. Atheism as the only valid world-view

c3eu1hc,t3_o6tvj,t3_o6tvj,Is_that_bad,,"Read and weep.
&gt;Several things are worth noting here. The first is that, in today’s Republican politics, one reliable way to reach beyond the Christian base is by whipping up nationalistic hysteria with language lifted straight from the McCarthy era. If criminalizing all abortions and nullifying all gay marriages are a little too sectarian for you, surely you’d like to try some old-fashioned traitor-hunting. (Santorum has also accused Obama of “sid[ing] with evil” in Iran, a country with which he plainly wants to go to war.)
&gt;
&gt;The second is that this kind of gutter rhetoric is so routine in the Republican campaign that it’s not worth a political journalist’s time to point it out. In 2008, when Michele Bachmann suggested that Barack Obama and an unknown number of her colleagues in Congress were anti-American, there was a flurry of criticism; three years later, when a surging Presidential candidate states it flatly about a sitting President, there’s no response at all. Certain forms of deterioration—like writers using “impact” as a verb, or basketball coaches screaming about every foul—become acceptable by attrition, because critics lose the energy to call them out. Eventually, people even stop remembering that they’re wrong.
&gt;
&gt;And the third, related point is that, once demagogy and falsehoods become routine, there isn’t much for the political journalist to do except handicap the race and report on the candidate’s mood.

Oh, I'm a summa cum laude graduate from a top ten engineering university.  But that isn't all that important.  Believe me, I questioned my sanity when I realized that my views, even before I learned what I know now, conflicted heavily with the mainstream view.  It was when I found a plethora of information confirming my suspicions that I finally gained confidence in the accuracy of my computations.

I'll say that I don't really care to analyze what you or I have said.  I don't find it that interesting, plus I am working on getting intoxicated and it is possible, though unlikely, that I made some sort of mistake.

Hm, I've now read your latest reply.

I thought about this, but it's not really face-saving at all.  It's just an attempt to find common ground in order to find the truth together.  I guess you are just a very good troll.  Congrats, I guess.  But that isn't a very good way to spend your energy.  It does explain a few things: I was unable to fully decipher you because you were putting up a front from the beginning. That was really all you had on me, and now you've let it slip.  If that isn't a win for me, it at least is a draw.  I do admit I was disappointed with your latest reply.

c48vdd8,t1_c48tf3k,t3_rtq7u,[deleted],,"You clearly have no concept of finances. Let's walk through an example:

You're a pretty wealthy guy. You're well off. You're making $170,000 a year, and you put some of that away every year. You have a boat, and a few cars, and of course, a pedigreed dog. Your family is living well.

Suddenly, disaster strikes. You're struck by an earthquake. Your house takes some structural damage, and you weren't insured for that. So you owe, let's say, $200,000 for repairs, and you start paying $200 a month to get insured. On a 48-month contract, which you signed to pay off that repair bill, you have to pay $8,340 every month. Oh wait, you had $50,000 in an emergency fund to get that lowered. You owe $6,250 per month now. Let's mark up your other expenses: $4,500 to pay off your vehicles, $200 a year to pay for your dog's health care, and $2,000 every six months for health insurance for your wife and children. You're covered by your work. You have to pay $5,000 a year in bills, you pay $3,800 a year for you country club, and you have a good sum to spend on entertainment.

Let's break it down:

+$170,000 (total income)

-$75,000 (repair payoff)

-$54,000 (vehicle loans)

-$500 (veterinary care)

-$4,000 (health insurance)

-$5,000 (bills)

-$3,800 (club dues)

&lt;hr /&gt;

+$27,700 (surplus)

Now, your kids have to go to college, right? Your oldest is 15, and so you have ~3 years to put away a good chunk. You've promised them this. Your younger child is 12, so you have ~6 years to save. It will cost ~$30,000 to send them to college, but you planned this out. You've paid off $18,000 for your older child and $14,000 for the younger. You usually put a couple thousand in each of their accounts, but since you were good with that, you need to put $1,300 a year into the older account and $2,600 into the younger. That means that $27,700 surplus is depleted to $23,800. Still a good chunk of change. 

Now, as it turns out some of those assets weren't really liquid. You're an investor type. About 20% of your income usually goes into mutual funds and stocks and bonds. That's $34,000, but your portfolio increases by 15% on average every year, for . You're allowed to take up to 10% out of those funds per year, because you signed a contract - because 70% is in CDs and bonds, and the bank depends on you to do its own investment - and your returns drop. Say you take some out of a mutual fund, because its performance has been pretty constant. You invest 8% less of your income, which drops your returns to 9%.

You have ~$633,000 in your portfolio, because you followed that formula for 7 years. You now have your investment under control, and you're only putting $20,400 away instead of $34,000. You have an entertainment budget of $7,300. Your portfolio is growing by $22,848 per year, with $2,448 due to your returns. Sadly, the earthquake also damaged a whole array of businesses that you're invested in, and before you can do anything, their stocks drop, and you lose about 25% of your portfolio. Several of them go into debt and those stocks become worthless, dropping it again by 15%. Your portfolio is now, immediately after the earthquake, ~$400,000. About 85% is in CDs and bonds now, of which 10% are going to mature in the next year, 30% in the next 5 years, and the remainder are not due for almost another decade. You're doing fine, even though you're worried. The funds you can access in the next year, including your entertainment budget *supra*, is ~$41,000.

Now our metaphor matures into what better represents the US's current condition. You are an executive for a local corporation, but you only get to watch the meetings. People with more money than you actually do the dealings and influence the company. The vote to try to save some cash, because your company was hit, too. It's leaking 10% of its $10 billion yearly income, and that 10% was double its discretionary spending. Someone needs to get a pay cut, or they need to cut back on spending, or both. The problem is, the majority of their salary spending is split between the executives and everyone else. Let's say they split $500 million between the two, and most of the 7,000 grunts earn $20,000 a year. The adminstration splits $250 million twenty ways: $160 million to the board of directors (five ways), 80 million to the big bosses (ten ways), and the other 10 million to people in your position (five ways). The board decides to cut your pay, along with 5,000 other people. With the funds derived from that, they reinvest it elsewhere. The company ends up doing well, and the investment gains mean they can edge up salaries again in about two years.

You're making $150,000 a year, now. You have $3,700 in extra spending, and you have $1,500 in an emergency fund, which can cover some expenses if they come out of nowhere. You almost have your older kid's college paid off. Your cars are almost paid off. You're sailing carefully. In two years, the repairs will be paid for, and you can have a huge chunk of your money back. It's just about time for salaries to come back, though, so that's good.

Your oldest child gets in a car accident. Besides still having to pay off the car, you also have their medical bills, and your premiums went up. That destroys the rest of your extra spending. You have a net gain of $500 this year, and oh by the way, the company invested in toxic assets which cost them $4 billion in losses. You see another pay cut on the horizon.

And it comes. Six months later, your child is on the road to recovery, but they are permanently disabled. The brain damage will make it impossible for them to attend college, so you have $28,700 to help cushion the blow of their medical care once they get done with rehab. Then, as neuro patients do, they hit a plateau. Your insurance company drops your child, and raises the premiums. You have to pay an additional $500 every six months, because now your family is a risk to them. You take money out of your bonds, which matured just in time, and you end up with ~$89,000 to pay for the expensive treatments your child requires, adding up 10% of your portfolio, which matured, and  the college money, and your $7,000 net income. Plus, you get hit with another $25,000 pay cut.

Let's see where you sit *now*.

+$125,000 (income)

-$75,000 (repairs)

-$54,000 (vehicles)

-$500 (pet)

-$5,000 (health insurance)

-$50,000 (rehab)

-$5,000 (bills)

-$3,800 (club dues)

&lt;hr /&gt;

-$68,300

Well fuck. Now you're going into debt. You'll be fine this year, but your next round of bonds don't mature for 3 years, your stocks are worthless, and you can't even afford to put more money into the mutual fund. That $89,000 will only cushion the blow for 1 year. This year, you still come out on top: $20,700. But next year, if you don't spend ANY extra money AT ALL this year, and that $20k carries over, you still go $40k into debt. What are you going to do?

The Republican solution is to cut ""spending"": in this case, the car insurance (which we'll call 50% of the vehicle payments). While it's a nice short-term solution, another accident would obliterate you. They might also elect to kill off the health insurance, but if anyone else got sick or injured, that might *double* your debt. The Democrat solution is to get your wife or 14-year-old to start working, and maybe cut out the country club dues. While the cuts are smaller than the Republican cuts, the added income could be as much as $30-$50,000, and paired with the smaller spending cuts, you could be in much less pain. Also, for a short-term boost you could sell the boat, but neither party is asking for something analogous, so I'm leaving it out.

c4ycqb2,t1_c4yce2l,t3_us866,dettoaltrimenti,,"&gt;The people on the school board may have the best interests of the children in mind. Unfortunately though, state and federal laws tie their hands on things like tenure, which teachers get after a few years of teaching. If parents think a tenured teacher is ineffective but he/she is not grossly misbehaving, firing them is not really an option for a school district. In New York, it can cost up to a quarter million dollars to fire a tenured teacher who isn't breaking any laws. If we were really concerned about education, we would fire teachers if a better one was available.  
  
I don't know how tenure works in New York (state, or city), but I know there are no federal laws regarding tenure. In my city (possibly state, too), teachers are in a 'probationary period' for the first five years, where they can be fired for any reason, including budgetary concerns. There are a minimum of two evaluations a year, the average of which must be 'above expectations' or higher: 'satisfactory' level teachers can work without tenure for as many years as the school renews their contract (i.e. tenure isn't 'required' after the 5 year probationary period). After receiving tenure, 'satisfactory' evaluations allow them to maintain tenure, and 'below expectations' for 2 consecutive years changes them to probationary status. Any tenured teacher participating in a strike is automatically changed to probationary status, and can be fired immediately. So apart from receiving a higher salary, tenure here just keeps bad teachers (that were good for at leaast 5 years) in schools for 2 years instead of 1, while giving tenured teachers the option to keep their post (i.e. not be forced to change schools) and their employment history (i.e. changing a tenured teacher to probationary can 'reset' their salary as if they had just started working, but individual teachers salaries can't be reduced while tenured). I think this is a pretty fair system. Do you have any recommendations on video/articles about the NY system?  
  
&gt;If parents could send their child to another school if they weren't happy with the teachers or curriculum, the school would need to change it's ways. The success of any given school would depend on how well it appealed to parents  
  
The No Child Left Behind Act partially did this: if a school is 'failing,' parents can transfer their children to any other school in the district.

Same difference.  You are simply being charged to exercise your freedom instead when money is spent.  So, how would fees be better than tax if the same money is collected?

So how would you go about determining how much wealth a person ""properly deserves""?  Who/what defines ""rich""?  Who/what defines ""power""?  It does not ""go over"" our heads.  We simply have divergent views of what the government was, and is, intended to be.  I, and I think most fiscal conservatives, do not think that it is the governments job to have so many entitlement programs in place that instead of a ""safety net"" you have a Barcalounger.  I happen to have a fantastic grasp on the concept that the money that wealthy people have IS NOT MINE.  It really doesn't matter whether or not Mitt could live off of $6 million/year.  I have no right to determine that.

Most of the ideas I see from non-fiscal conservatives for ""fixing"" governmental debt/spending issues are predicated on a existing ""elite"" class of wealthy individuals that you can take money from.  What do you do then?

Moreover a free market system might also work if we understand free markets to be creations of the government and if we focus on ensuring larger numbers and varieties of insurers, if we focus on restricting patent rights in medicine, and focus on taking on groups like the AMA.

When I attended school and we talked about issues, sometimes the black students and professors would say they felt a certain level of frustration or lack of opportunity and attributed it to being discriminated due their race. I felt those feelings too, and I am not a minority but I was poor. I argued that much of this was due to poverty and lack of opportunity. 

The institutional racism is kind of self-perpetuating. I heard many stories of black families whose children had been killed or wounded in gang violence. They had conversations among themselves about how to solve it but it was not a subject open to general conversation. It concerned me how criminal behavior was waved off as necessary because of the lack of jobs, yet statistically most of the crimes were against other minorities. 

There are substantial barriers to overcome in poverty situations. Education is huge. But so is transportation, housing, food, and training. Obama wasn't wrong the other day when he said “We know that we have to invest in transitional jobs too. When there are people who are homeless, veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder from this war in Iraq, and thousands of children aging out of foster care, we can’t expect them to have all the skills they need for work. They may need help with basic skills—how to show up to work on time, wear the right clothes, and act appropriately in an office."" 

I agree completely with that. Where I disagree is who is responsible for providing that to the poor. Obama continues ""We (the government) have to help them get there. That’s why I have called for $50 million to begin innovative new job training and workforce development programs.”

Obama wasn't taught these things by the government. He had and sought out mentors for himself. Boys especially need strong men to mentor them. That isn't the government's responsibility or role. It is a community level role. ",1350568181.0,2,0,,False,0,,,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,2012,10,0.22980402

Penny's and Fashion Bug. After all, every single one of these services are ""basic"" necessities that, in your view, cannot be left to the predatory auspices of the marketplace. 

If competitive price negotiations and bargain-hunting on the part of consumers can't drive down costs in health care, then, by your logic, it can't do that for any of these other services. If the market only works for electronic appliances, entertainment-related purchases, and facial makeovers, then - gawshums - I guess we at r/Conservative need to start having a ""reasonable discussion"" (as those have you who have hijacked this subreddit in the wake of Obama's re-election like to throw in ideological hardliner's faces in order to shut down all opposing arguments that threaten your worldview) about, well.. a complete government takeover of all essential utilities and such. 

The idea that say, a supposedly ""trivial"" adjustment like lifting restrictions on HSAs can't help matters is bogus. National studies find that - get this - HSAs bring medical costs down [30 percent](http://www.hsafinder.com/Nationwide-Study) for the average patient. How very useless! You're right, though. Giving people an incentive to shop around for the best bargain and get the highest bang for their buck - by making them pocket more of the costs rather than rely entirely on a third party payer - can't *possibly* bring down prices. Pshh. 

And rolling back the red tape? Why, that can't possibly work either! That's why - gasp! - the number of uninsured went up by 8.6 percent, on average, in the sixteen states that went on a mandating spree in the four years following the dawn of the 90s, while the 34 states that didn't get with the program only saw that number rise by little more than 1 percent.

If people are interested in listening to what the person is communicating, attacks against them are going to be less effective. People will listen to messages that are longer and more nuanced than a sound bite. When attacked, people will actually listen to their rebuttal. Baseless attacks won't stick, but that doesn't give them a free pass on actual criticism.

If you really want to see an example of this, go watch a [Bill Clinton speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EXNrdzwB4M) on mute. Then go watch [Romney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMuU-EwcIzs) on mute. After that, listen to how they talk. Clinton doesn't click his tongue, he has warmth in his voice, he knows when to change the inflection of words, when to increase the volume of his voice, when to pause, and so much more. Romney might as well be nails on a chalkboard. Disregarding political views and campaign gaffs, there is a very apparent reason why Clinton was a successful politician and Romney failed.",1353091404.0,1,0,,False,0,,,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,2012,11,0.063423134

Mass-murderers who target these locations want to make a statement, and usually don't care about getting away. But of course, if you want to make an impact you will chose somewhere that you can kill a few at least before dying, so you wouldn't chose somewhere that is guaranteed to have lots of guns to get shot with.

I'm sorry, but this point is wrong. While I understand and agree with your point, that people who really want to kill themselves will do it somehow, the facts simply do not support your hypothesis. As indicated by the [NIMH here](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/suicide-in-the-us-statistics-and-prevention/index.shtml#Firearms), and [other](http://www.mendeley.com/research/household-firearm-ownership-suicide-rates-united-states/) [sources](http://www.deathreference.com/En-Gh/Firearms.html), gun presence in a home increases the likelyhood of suicide. That's not opinion, nor debatable, it is fact.

Now, what do I support is not banning guns, as you seem to think. I support gun control. We already have gun control (waiting period, background checks, permits, classes, etc), and that's working pretty well so far. Still, people manage to do horrible things with their legal weapons. What we need is stricter gun control. More classes, harsher background checks, etc. Of course, we also need to work harder to get illegal guns off the streets, as well as social outreach programs to those at high risk of owning a gun, and a reduction in the violence in our society.",1354571815.0,1,0,,False,0,,,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,2012,12,0.28425202

I do feel that one of our larger problems is, in fact, Pay for teachers. Not necessarily from an overall compensation standpoint, but from the aspect of you are making MAYBE 35-40k/yr at one of the more 'prestigious' high schools (Not talking anything crazy, but more 'upscale' like a Catholic College Prep, hopefully you get my Gist.) And that would be a good pay rate, if it wasn't for the bit where High school teaching (at least in this state) requires a Masters degree, or continual work towards a masters. Put that requirement with budget/pay cuts as well as Rising tuition costs and you drive away a lot of the talent.

Not true.  They would never provide the service of a same sex wedding to anyone.  Well, I am just taking them at their word on that point but I see no reason to doubt their religious convictions.  They fought this all the way through the court system after all.  

&gt;I imagine if hobby lobby was trying to avoid providing health care to only gay people on religious grounds they would have lost.

Of course.  It doesn't violate their religious beliefs to give gay employees health insurance.  

&gt;I also can't imagine them winning in court if they fired an employee who turned out to be gay.  The argument could be made that on religious grounds they shouldn't have to hire gay people.  One would have to make a pretty strong case that their ability to function as a christian is impaired by hiring a gay person however I can't imagine anyone agreeing.

I agree with this assessment.  I don't know of any element of Christian dogma that having a gay employee violates.  

&gt;One might feel their freedom to practice their religion is impaired by a gay couple moving next door to them but that's obviously bullshit. A business is more or less seen the same way. It's not a church or purely religious establishment.

One really can't object to people moving in next to you generally.  Everyone has a universal right to reside in this country as long as they don't violate anyone's property rights.  

Though this poses an interesting hypothetical.  There are legal instruments called covenants that run with land.  In the past they were used to maintain segregated neighborhoods, the owner of the land had to agree not to sell it to black people when they bought it.  A landmark Supreme Court case said enforcing that covenant in a state civil court was a state action that violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.  

Suppose a neighborhood entered into a covenant to not sell any land to gay people.  Given the recent DOMA case it would be a rather open question I think whether enforcing the covenant violated the 14th Amendment.  (By open I mean I don't think there is an absolutely compelling argument one way or the other, this is the fertile ground that new Constitutional law is growing in).

After that, sure...lots of police actions and smoke and mirrors.  But to make your 1812 claim that that was the last time we fought for OUR freedom is simplistic and naive.  It's not even the last time we fought on our own soil.

That's just the simplistic view of it.  Lack of freedom comes in manner forms and often times without physical chains.  The Spanish American war was fought to maintain freedom in how the US deals with the New World by casting out the last European power.  The first Gulf War was fought over oil so that the US could maintain a little freedom in energy and not be placed in a stranglehold by Iraq over oil.  

Vietnam...Korea...War on Terror...these were fights against ideology.  Tougher to come away with tangible arguments of freedom but still, the terrorists have been beaten back some and the USSR fell while China is more capitalist in many regards than even WE are.

Why do liberals want to eliminate the conservative truths from history books?  Because it's an undeniable fact that logical, conservative, common sense truths undermines the perspective of reality in socialist liberals. What Kryptonite is to Superman, the truth is to liberals, socialism is to freedom.

Another reason why history books are being rewritten in the slant of the liberal perspective and children being indoctrinated into thinking like liberals is so that children are not aware of what mistakes were made, therefore, similar mistakes are doomed to be repeated. Common Core explicitly eliminates the conservative explanation of history.

Common Core closes a childs mind from thinking independently and outside the box which forces them to be narrow minded.

In the real socialist world under marxist tyranny, competition of superior minds, skills and innovation ceases to exist and what's left is a society in absolute destitute ruin, poverty, crime, and self mutilation.

cdc5oq0,t3_1qdzsl,t3_1qdzsl,tamuowen,,"This is one of the worst articles I've had the displeasure of reading. It reeks of conspiracy theories, strong assertions with no supporting evidence, and a constant hypocrisy. I'm all for criticizing Obama, but this is one of the worst attempts I've ever seen. 

So, the author begins by insinuating that Obama never actually went to Columbia (or if he went he didn't do anything to deserve a degree). But he never actually has the guts to directly state it:

&gt;But not Obama. I never met him, saw him, or even heard of him. Not one of my friends at Columbia ever met him either. At our 30th class reunion last May, I could not find a single classmate who had ever met him. Strange story, but I digress.

Ah, so Obama never actually attended Columbia.

&gt;Everyone needs to hear my story because what Obama and I learned at Columbia explains EXACTLY what Obama is doing to America today.
&gt;Obama may not have attended class, but he learned well.

But what he learned at Columbia (while he was never there), is exactly what he's currently doing to this country. 

&gt;It’s a purposeful, brilliant plan hatched at Columbia University to destroy capitalism, American exceptionalism, Judeo-Christian values, and the American Dream.

Ah, now I see - Columbia University is a key player in a conspiracy to destroy all of the things you love. They must be, after all, if they gave Obama a degree he never earned and taught him how to hate America.

&gt;My classmates hated America. They spoke with glee about one day  ”taking the system down.” They blamed America for “unfairness, racism, inequality, and lack of social justice.”

&gt;In 1981 when a student burst through the doors to our political science class and screamed  “The President has been shot. They’ve assassinated Reagan”… my classmates yelled, hugged, high-fived, and jumped up and down cheering the death of a Republican. 

Holy shit - these people hated America so much that they immediately and openly cheered (what they thought was) the death of the sitting President of the United States in the middle of a college classroom?

&gt;Today most of my classmates are either in government with Obama, or controlling the mainstream media.

The conspiracy continues. They were so well brainwashed by Columbia that they were rewarded with jobs brainwashing and controlling others. Since, we all know that colleges exist for the sole reason of brainwashing young conservatives. 

&gt;So that explains the plan. But how do you implement it? We were taught that at Columbia too. A key component of the plan involved fooling the voters by calling yourself “moderate” and a “uniter,” even though you are a radical Marxist. We were taught to never admit what you really believe in. It involved demonizing your opponents, calling them “evil, greedy, extreme, radical, and terrorist.” Look in the mirror and call your opponents the very things you are.

So the key component to destroying America is spreading the Marxist, Communist, Socialist agenda to destroy the American Dream. You do this by demonizing their opponents. 

&gt;They talked about how the “white power structure” had to be dismantled, business owners bankrupted, and capitalism destroyed. Sound like the policies of anyone you recognize in the White House? 

You do this by calling them Extreme and Radical

&gt;my first political science class at Columbia was “Communism 101″ taught by Professor Trotsky in the Fidel Castro Building, at the corner of Marx Blvd. and Lenin Drive.

&gt;I’m only half-kidding. My experiences at Columbia were not far off.

This entire article was rife with ridiculous assertions with absolutely nothing other than the author's word to back them up. He never makes even the slightest attempt to appear professional or unbiased. He uses the exact same emotional tactics he attacks Obama for using. 

But I guess I shouldn't expect much from the author of a book titled: **The Ultimate Obama Survival Guide: How to Survive, Thrive, and Prosper During Obamageddon.**

Ignoring the fact that doctors have a legal and ethical responsibility to do what's best for the patient, private insurance companies have had what you describe as ""death panels"" for decades in order to control their costs.  I doubt that you're arguing on /r/Conservative that the government should not control costs when it comes to spending on healthcare - but that's what it sounds like.

2. Private health care insurance companies do have a lot more regulation than they did previously.  But they have loads of power to decide which types of procedures or prescriptions they'll cover outside of the ""Essential Beneift Requirements.""  Who decides what's covered by the Essential Benefits Requirements?  Each individual state - which is a power they had before Obamacare.

3. Honestly, go google it.  Costs in the individual market are down up to 50% in NY state and 25% in New Jersey.  Do you have to know someone personally before you'll believe it?  Then go make friends with very small business owners or contract workers on the east coast.

4. Cutting out fraud and abuse where?  In the private sector?  Because that was the problem.  People couldn't get private health insurance if they had a pre-existing condition - or they could get insurance and it wouldn't actually cover catastrophic illness or injury.  Allowing plans over state lines sounds good, but in reality it's taking power away from each state to determine their own insurance rules.  You'd have to pass legislation saying that a cut rate insurance company from Texas could do business in NY and NY couldn't regulate them and vice versa.

However, Obamacare did include [Health Care Choice Compacts](http://www.ncsl.org/portals/1/documents/health/HealthRef_GoldbergLS10.pdf) which allow states to get together and sell insurance across their borders.

cgj4fi5,t1_cgiy2kt,t3_222nvs,runnernerd,,"&gt; But the anti-ID crowd still complains. Why? Because you might need to spend money on a replacement birth certificate, etc, to get that ID.

Yep.  ID is not currently required to vote.  If we pass a law forcing the citizenry to acquire ID and make them pay for the supporting documentation required to receive the ID it amounts to a poll tax.  

&gt; If you looked at every expense as a ""poll tax"" then the government would have to provide free transportation to everyone on election day. You have to be consistent here. 

I'm being consistent. Government has never provided transportation to polling stations and expecting them to do so now would be inconsistent.  I do think more polling places should be available, though, to make it easier for those without transportation to vote.

&gt; Everyone gets a birth certificate for free when they are born. Maybe each state could allow for one free replacement after that? But you can't just allow unlimited replacements at no cost. 

Not every US citizen is born in a US hospital.  Those born at home in the backwoods of the Ozarks may not have a birth certificate.  Some citizens are born in foreign countries. Some citizens were born before these documents were the norm.  There are plenty of valid reasons one may not have a birth certificate.   

&gt; Even if you spent money on an ID, it wouldn't be a ""poll tax"" anyway, because you need an ID for everything under the sun. Cash a paycheck, welfare check, social security check or an unemployment check (or to open a bank account to set up the direct deposit for it)

Suddenly requiring a document that costs money to cast a vote that previously wasn't required is a poll tax.  

I didn't have a government issued ID until I was 21 and got along just fine with school ID's, my SS card, and a library card. 
Retailers, like grocery stores, will cash paychecks for their employees.  No ID needed there.  Lots of people cash checks at their place of employement.  Additionally, I didn't show ID when I became employed at 16.

EDIT:  The only reason I got a government ID at 21 was to purchase alcohol at a different store than the one in which I worked. Had I been a non-drinker I would have waited until I started driving at 24.",1396541607.0,5,0,,1396542074,0,,,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,2014,4,0.06817148

The moment that the US government determined that the Constitution was an inviolable document, rather than an a voluntary compact.  The Anti-Federalists fears have all come true.

If the Bill of Rights had merely been obeyed, then we'd never come to this point.

Tenth: *The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people*

And he was a teenager at the time who had to drop out of elementary school to help support his family. I would assume that with Spanish as the parents first language, and having little exposure to English speakers at that time due to having to work instead of learn due to the economic situation at the time that he would.... speak Spanish? I'm sorry that his failure to perfectly assimilate was not enough for you. I'm quite sure he would have rather continued his schooling than picking peaches for minimum wage. But you know what? His grandson is going to an Ivy League school in the fall, and he was overjoyed by that. The grandson of a peach farmer, going to one of the best schools not only in the nation but in the world? That's amazing, and those are the kinds of success stories that America is about. There was no expectation of equal results, but only of equal opportunity in America. Each generation strives to give the next generation a better life than the one they had and it's clear that this was achieved. 

The media makes a point of highlighting any time an illegal immigrant commits a crime. We do not have perfect numbers on the number of illegal immigrants in this country, but we do have an estimate of almost 12 million. Now, if the majority of those were criminals, I don't even think this administration would be that foolish to allow illegal immigration to continue to grow as it has.

And once again. Did I ever say that it was our job? In our country we have something called due process of the law. We don't just kick people out because we think they may be illegal immigrants. At least, according to our constitution we're not supposed to. These are people looking for better lives, much like your ancestors were once they came here (assuming your ancestry is not Native American) and the Founding Fathers. No one would leave their country for a worse life. 


You need to realize that I am not supporting illegal immigration by any means. Once I again I will say that I am just attempting to clarify the Pope's comments. Even though these are illegal immigrants, we still owe those who come here (with good intentions, so obviously not the cartels and whatnot) dignity and respect.

* What are groups composed of if not individuals? The idea they propose assumes that the individual is somehow irrelevant or nonexistent thanks to the social group. This obviously is not the case. Each person is a sentient being with consciousness and  free will. 

*If you take a look at neolithic archeological sites, as well as modern day tribal societies inplaces like the Amazon and Africa, you find that the social group is largely family and some extended family with a small dose of transients. The idea that humans evolved a social unit based on relatives somehow = Big government is a massive leap to make. In the end it also still suffers from the first point, that the group is made up of individuals.

*If we measure success in terms of traditional economic measures of standard of living, those societies with institutions that promote and protect the *indidvidual* are more successful than others. These societies have promoted things like free speech, right to bear arms, free markets and so on; the stronger the protections of the individual the more succesful the society typically becomes. Even in cases where the society is culturally biased towards collectivist impulses like China, Once an institution becomes a breeding ground for individualism the society typically becomes much better off. I use China as an example because of their slow and steady increasing embrace of free markets. Ironically to those on the left, it is individual protecting/promoting institutions that promote the well-being of the group the best.

*Lastly the evolution argument is total garbage anyways. If we argue from the standpoint that Humans evolved the largest most complex Brains in the animal kingdom we can conclude that humans are the most cognitively independent, prudent, and *individualistic* beings ever to walk the planet. This I would say is one of the best arguments against them because it is a direct confrontation to their drivel and is probably the easiest to accept for people who don't already agree with us.

Single payer would be a drastic improvement fiscally. The reason healthcare costs are so insane is because of the crazy price negotiation dance between the hospitals and health insurance companies. Hospitals can charge exorbitant amounts because they know the money is guaranteed by the health insurance companies...who then pass off the costs to us in higher deductibles/premiums/etc. If there were no health insurance, costs would plummet...as they do for people without insurance who can pay out of pocket.

Anyways, what is the point of wasting my time arguing this? After all, even if single payer were a net positive you would still be against it due to your last paragraph. This is why I can't get behind conservative philosophies...because at the end of the day, they're all rooted in ""I don't like X group of people and don't want them to benefit, even if it means society is better as a whole"".

cnlui7r,t1_cnldivg,t3_2s0foh,Fmeson,,"&gt; A kink in the rope of that desire is that equality is subjective. Even though we can legislate equality before the law, in employment, in educational opportunity, and marriage, we can't legislate behaviour. We can't guarantee by means of law that everyone is nice to everyone else they meet. It would be nice if everyone was nice, but I wouldn't want to live in a society that mandated that.


Most modern feminism is about de facto inequality and not de jure inequality as you say, so it isn't about legislation. Some people will want to mandate certain things, but that won't change behavioral hurdles. So I agree with you about this point. 

&gt;I think I understand why some people say that anyone who wants equality between the sexes is a feminist, whether those people ID as one or not. It makes sense, and it's true. But I am not a feminist as most of my social sciences and liberal arts educated peers would define it. Feminism has an ideological problem, and that's where I disagree with you and our opinions diverge.

We could debate the exact meaning of feminism till the cows come home, but frankly it doesn't matter. If you support equal opportunity for men and women and will try to avoid unfair bias than I don't really care what you want to be called.

I'm not here to apologize for anybody, but when there are cancers like lung, liver and colorectal cancer that have less than a 20% chance of surviving 5 years, with most of that time being time spent in bed, feeling awful, a constant struggle to survive, I think that deserves our tax dollars more than a cancer where most afflicted with it make it into their 70s and 80s without symptoms, pain or experience illness.

If you get prostate cancer, it's highly likely that you'll live long enough that something else kills you.  With other cancers, your life is destroyed in a short matter of time.  It also drags families through a nightmare.  When grandpa starts to feel pain from prostate cancer when he hits 82, the general feeling is ""Well, something's bound to get him eventually!""

So yes, I think funding anything about prostate cancer other than awareness and testing can probably take a back seat to some more pressing illnesses.

Isn't this /r/Conservative?  It looks like you are trying to find excuses to fund more government.

Do you understand what kind of a massive success story it would be to make lung, stomach or breast cancer have a 94% survivability after 15 years?  That's Nobel Prize material for whomever comes up with that cure.  That's where prostate cancer is right now.

On second thought, that's not where we are with prostate cancer *right now*.

That's where we *were* with data reported from *4 years ago*.

She start at maximum stupid right out of the box. This horse is a runner:

&gt; [begins the interview with a little synopsis that proves she knows nothing about Reddit. She's using the wrong terminology. She has some wires crossed] ... a lot of the community, frankly, wasn't ever gonna like her because she was an Asian woman.

She emphasizes the word 'woman' over the word 'Asian'. 

Then, she goes on a rant about how Pao was so brave for taking on sexism in Silicon Valley, and her sexual discrimination lawsuit vs. KP - completely ignoring the fact that a jury has decided that Pao's lawsuit was without merit and Pao lost, and lost *badly*. 

During this rant she actually uses the word 'micro-indignities'. I threw up in my mouth a little. 

My eyes kind of glazed over after that much stupid crammed into 45 seconds. I'm sure she said other stuff, too. 

The fact of the matter is that maybe 1% of Redditors would have any clue who Ellen Pao is had Reddit not done some stupid things lately, finally placed that last straw on the proverbial camel's back, and a grass-roots revolt ensued. Hundreds of subs (including defaults) went dark in protest. 

Reddit is 99% run by users. The users fought back over various issues. 

It was kind of a digital version of the Boston Tea Party ... and Pau and her sex and her race had dick-all to do with it. 

There's no sexism or racism involved at all. Interjecting it into a conversation means that you have a losing argument. 

In fact, if you do a Reddit search for 'asian women' - every result is highly upvoted.

My point is that this social arrangement can cause a lot of problems, for men and women alike. This is especially the case in patrilocal arrangements where men are expected to have a family home of their own before they marry.

The fact of the matter is that governing in any sort of democracy is an exercise in compromise; completely alienating everyone left of center *and* all non-Tea Party conservatives only serves to limit your party's influence and keep it from being able to enact any of the changes you want to see.

I'll also go ahead and respond to your second post here, just to consolidate the discussion.

&gt; ""No wonder conservatives rally behind anti-establishment figures.. Ted Cruz draws heavy grassroots support for slicing Planned Parenthood funding out of the latest continuing resolution, even if it means Obama vetoing the CR, thus shutting down the government. Conservatives didn't elect Republicans to build a power base. They elected them to enact conservative policy preferences, no matter the cost."" We want our country back. You may feel that our two party system is working for you, but I don't feel it is for conservatives like me. That's why I support Ted Cruz. Link: http://m.townhall.com/columnists/benshapiro/2015/10/01/the-republican-partys-big-choice-n2059342

I have to ask: what good does shutting down the government over Planned Parenthood funding do? If President Obama vetoes the bill (and he will) and the bill doesn't get 2/3 Senate vote to override the veto (and it won't)... then the government just got shut down for nothing. Funding for Planned Parenthood still doesn't get cut, and the media will ensure that the general public places blame for the shutdown on men like Senator Cruz. Under mounting public pressure from both the media and their constituents, more and more Republican Congressmen will cave in until a CR passes that includes PP funding. All that will have happened throughout that process is that conservatives lose more face and influence among the public, making it harder for them to court voters and enact conservative policy.

You may be fed up with the GOP establishment, but the fact is they're governing the way a political party *should* govern when they aren't currently courting majority influence among voters. They have to step carefully, or risk being disregarded altogether. Ask yourself, as the GOP loses face and voters move away from supporting it, just how many of those voters do you think will move in and support the Tea Party instead? How many will move their support to a more centrist candidate? How many will begin supporting liberal candidates, having become disenfranchised with their former party? Are those risks really worth the Tea Party helping to tear apart the GOP?",1443823169.0,3,0,,False,0,,,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,2015,10,0.08479069

So you are saying that since women like the AR-15 it can't possible be a """"military-style"" ""assault rifle.  Apparently women just can't handle a military grade weapon.

Fact: Guns are tools to propel a bullet at a high velocity.  The intention of the user is irrelevant.

&gt; MYTH: If you need defense, call 9-1-1.
FACT: The Supreme Court has ruled 7-2 that the police have no legal obligation to protect your life.

it is true that 911 is useless for many attacks like home invasion.  But your reference to police not being legally required to protect citizens is simply unhelpful.  Almost every police department makes every effort to respond promptly to emergencies and will do the absolute best they can.  So this statement about legal responsibility is meant to undermine police departments and their relationship with the citizenry.

&gt; MYTH: Guns are the #1 killer of children.

I don't think you can find that statement on even the most virulent anti-gun sites.

&gt; MYTH: Lead bullets are bad for the environment. FACT: Only if you eat them... “The notion that you can get lead out of the environment showed these people should not have passed their high-school chemistry test,” said Mr. Keane. “Lead is in the periodical table. There is no more lead in the environment than there was 100 years ago.” 

Mr. Keane is an idiot who has no idea what he is talking about.  All the lead poisoning in Flint Mi came from inert metallic lead.  The reason leaded gas was banned 30 years ago is because Americans were being poisoned as they drove their cars.  That is what 100 million tons of lead  per year does to people.  Lead shot on the other hand has much less impact, but in some shooting ranges and popular hunting areas streams will get full of lead shot and that can be a bit of a local problem.

Do I really need to point out that the two people with the lowest favorability ratings in history just won the election for their respective primaries?

Yea and Trump is losing because he is less favorable than Clinton.

&gt;They got exactly what they wanted. They wanted a CR, and they got it.

They wanted a lot more.  They knew realistically all they could get was a CR.  Big Big difference.

&gt;Tell that to Bush in '06...

An anomoly year caused by his low favorables due to Katrina and Iraq.

&gt;But I do agree, in a fashion. Most of the Democrat's voting base are low-information, enough to where the Presidential elections are the only ones that really hit their radar.

Also religious people vote more often.

&gt;Because they couldn't convince their own people it was a good idea. Republicans never had a seat at that table, and never had a voice in any of it.

You still needed all of the GOP to vote No on Cloture...  You can't ignore that.

&gt;Which went up, especially capital gains...

All before the GOP had any control, and not nearly as high as Obama wanted.

&gt;Also went up, although I think you are correct to point out that it hasn't really gone up that much since Republicans took over.

Not in real terms...  It has been flat in real terms...

Republicans want to cut spending(except for Trump) and Democrats want to increase.  When you have a divided government you get a compromise which is flat spending.

&gt;That is one area where the GOP is pretty strong, but if Hillary gets in, expect an end-run around Congress, and DC vs. Heller to be overturned.

How?  The GOP won't lose the Senate enough to have an Anti-Heller Judge rammed down their throat.  They can block any anti-heller judge the same as the Dems block any anti-roe judge.

&gt;End-run around them straight to the EPA.

Nothing close to cap and trade.

&gt;What Obama claims he wanted to do and what he actually wanted are two different things. When he first came into office, the Democrats held all of the keys to the kingdom. They did do what they wanted to do.

They had all of the keys for only about 2 months...  Laws take a long time to get written.  You can't get a lot done in two months.

&gt;Does BLM really want or expect to get all of their demands?
Or are they including things on that list that they know will never happen, just so they can have something to continually justify their manufactured outrage?

&gt; In the coming Trump years, conflicts will accelerate on various questions involving nationalism. Should immigrants be “Americanized” via a process of “patriotic integration,” or integrated into a “multicultural/transnational society”? How should we be governed — by American constitutionalism, or by international law? Should our government be rooted in American sovereignty, or in global governance? And should our policies on language and education be inspired by ideas of national cohesion, or by those of ethnic separatism and/or transnational identity? At the core, these are all serious “regime” questions of self-government. Do the American people have the right to perpetuate their way of life, or not? Do Americans have the right to rule themselves, or will others (e.g., foreign judges) make crucial decisions for them?

We need to return to a more nationalist perspective in how we handle our government internally and our relations internationally.  This is important, because on almost every point that matters - particularly immigration, which I'll use as an example in a minute - the Republican establishment has failed us tremendously by refusing to believe in American exceptionalism.  

&gt; But Republicans in general, and presidential candidates in particular, were late to the party. Except for Senator Jeff Sessions, who led the fight in Congress, and Donald Trump, who did so in the primaries, professional Republicans at all levels — donors, consultants, candidates, and incumbents — were bullied away from raising the issue, for fear of being thought unrespectable. Even some conservatives felt the same.

This unwillingness to confront a massive and pressing issue characterized - and still characterizes - much of the Republican establishment.  Until Trump acted as a nuclear detonation in the political conversation on immigration, Republicans were quite willing to compromise and yield and abandon every position and promise that they made.  See the Gang of Eight for the most egregious example, but there are plenty of others.  Conservatives let themselves be backed into a corner on issues, with the only options being 'endure media scorn and attacks' or 'capitulate to the Left in part or whole'.  

We need to believe in our cause again.  We need to take a stand, go full steam ahead, and damn the ~~torpedoes~~ media's screeching.  If we do that, and if we hold the course, Trump has demonstrated that we can win.

That. That is exactly what is wrong with it. A living child growing inside of its other was dissected for the purpose of convenience and profit 'in the name of science' and you ask what's wrong with it. 

It has not been done with the express consent of the mother, in many cases.

Like my prior statement, I'm baffled that you can defend the actions of this group. 

Just because something is legal, regarded as scientifically beneficial, and done with consent of the 'owner' does not mean it is moral or right. The individual in question, the child, has rights like anyone else.

Sure. It is referred to what is called the nullification crisis.  
Essentially the South namely South Carolina, absolutely hated the Tariff of 1828 and the Tariff of 1832. South Carolina then essentiallly themselves declared the tariffs unconstitutional and nullified the law with the Ordinance of Nullification. So the president at the time, Jackson, got a law passed called the Force Bill and sent the military down to South Carolina to enforce the tariff. What resulted was a compromised Tariff of 1833, but it also ended with South Carolina still thinking that it can nullify laws. So southern states would threaten to nullify(and would nullify) attempts to limit slavery and tax bills.. Then 1860 came and Lincoln won the election. A lot of factions in the South assumed that Lincoln would put an end to slavery and make blacks socially equal to whites etc.  
So South Carolina leading the charge, used the theory of nullification as justification to refuse to accept the results of the election and rallying the other southern states to secede.(if you think about it seceding is an extreme example of nullification) hence starting the Civil War.",1481863833.0,2,0,,1481864425,0,,False,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,2016,12,0.11305673

Timothy McVeigh was an antigovernment militia member and he blew up the Federal Building for his antigovernment beliefs. He chose a Federal building for a reason. He is arguably not a psychopath but a warrior for his misguided cause. Has anyone ever said McVeigh is excused for his crimes (and the militia movement is untarnished) because ""he was a psychopath, not a terrorist?"" No, because it is impossible to divorce his crimes from his political motive.

The Virginia Tech killer murdered a large number of kids for no overarching ideology. He pretty clearly had psychiatric issues and did not seek treatment.

The Pulse nightclub shooter pledged allegiance to an Islamic terrorist group before murdering people. Regardless of whether or not he was a psychopath he killed people for a political cause (Islamism). However, the research on the topic concludes that Islamic terrorists aren't actually pyschopaths because instability and the desire to commit random violence aren't traits of  effective terrorists. 

It's pretty silly to keep painting a political movement with a broad brush and stating that they're all psychopaths. I find it hard to believe that ISIS is made up entirely of psychopaths and not the rational, religiously motivated figures that appear on the nightly news. To use an example, Baghdadi is the latest in a line of terrorist leaders starting with Zarqawi in the early to mid 2000s. Bagdhadi is a shoe-in for leadership of a caliphate because he traces his lineage back to Muhammed, a distinction that bin Laden couldn't claim.

This was settled by the US Attorney for Southern New York, Preet Bharara's old district, it was basically his case but he had been released before the settlement final and replaced by a temp, Joon H Kim. Seems misleading to me because while they have been accused of defrauding the Russian gov treasury, it seems what the US could prove or had jurisdiction over was only around 1.9 million and  Prevezon has to pay over 5 million. 

&gt;Defendant Prevezon Holdings Ltd. Agrees to Pay $5,896,333.65, Triple the Fraud Proceeds Alleged to Be Directly Traceable to the Defendants

&gt;Joon H. Kim, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that the United States has settled a money laundering and civil forfeiture action against assets of 11 corporations, including some that own luxury residential and high-end commercial real estate in Manhattan. The Government’s complaint alleged that the defendant corporations laundered some proceeds of a $230 million Russian tax refund fraud scheme involving corrupt Russian officials that was uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in pretrial detention in Moscow under suspicious circumstances and was posthumously prosecuted by Russia.

 &gt;In the stipulation of settlement filed with U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III today, which is still subject to approval by the Court, one of the defendant corporations, Prevezon Holdings Ltd., agrees to pay $5,896,333.65 to resolve the Government’s claims against all defendants. This payment represents triple the value of the proceeds that the Government alleged could be traced directly from the Russian treasury fraud to the defendants ($1,965,444.55), and more than ten times the amount of proceeds the Government alleged could be traced directly to property in New York (approximately $582,000).

 &gt;Acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim said: “We will not allow the U.S. financial system to be used to launder the proceeds of crimes committed anywhere – here in the U.S., in Russia, or anywhere else. Under the terms of this settlement, the defendants have agreed to pay not just what we alleged flowed to them from the Russian treasury fraud, but three times that amount, and roughly 10 times the money we alleged could be traced directly into U.S. accounts and real estate.”

&gt; Ten countries permit second trimester abortion on request. This contrasts with 54 countries that allow abortion on request only in the first trimester.
 Four of the ten do not set upper time limits on second trimester abortions. Sweden specifies 18 weeks, Singapore 24 weeks, and the Netherlands and the United States “viability,” but all allow some abortions on specific grounds after that. **Eight of the ten countries are either developed countries** or former Soviet bloc countries. With notable exceptions, such as India and South Africa, countries allowing abortion for socio-economic reasons or on request in the second trimester are places where obtaining a second trimester abortion is relatively easy and safe.


Just about every country (there are exceptions of course, a couple dozen countries outlaw it completely) allows second trimester abortions to save the womans life, or for health reasons, sometimes fetal impairment or pregnancies resulting from a sex offense .....situations like that.

The other ISP was Frontier, who continues to offer 8 mbps as their maximum.  

Previously it was a choice of evils.  Neither company was doing upgrades or investing money in the infrastructure at all, since they had an effective monopoly.  Once the smaller crappier company got bought out, a lot of people switched over to the improved service, away from Frontier.  The end result is that either Frontier will modernize their infrastructure, or they'll lose all their customers and be bought out.  In time, the cycle may repeat again.

dv5suti,t1_dv5rzs5,t3_81vkcz,demographics,,"Well let's look at public education.  America is failing terribly- yes, even when Obama tried his hardest to boost federal education, our scores just sank.  Meanwhile our private schools do much better than public.  Turns out the federal government trying to interfere in education doesn't work.

I've never heard of a Republican against roads.  Even extreme libertarians agree the government's role is to protect freedom and provide infrastructure.  So if it's roads you're worried about, relax, we all agree they're necessary.

If by protections in the workplace you mean unions, they were great when they started.  Citizens uniting to ensure their rights, nothing wrong with that.  But now find me one industry where they haven't become a cancer.  They make it completely impossible to fire someone, no matter how shitty that person is.  Both of my parents were in unions (by force) and both of my parents hated unions.  If a person freely chooses to be in a union, and a company freely chooses to hire a union worker, that's fine.  That's free market.  But when companies can force people to join their union and pay dues, and force companies to only hire those from their union, the union has gotten way too much power.  Workers acting in groups is completely fine but workers forcing people to bend to their rules and pay them for the pleasure is abuse of power.  No one, even liberals, likes hearing that no matter how much you suck at your job, you're guaranteed to keep it and get raises every year because the union will sue if the company fires you for sucking.

Healthcare, you can see the benefits of a free market if you look.  Google the top hospitals in the world.  How many are in America?  Google how much medical research is done by each country.  You'll be amazed how dominant America is.  Want to know why?  Because profit.  Companies are willing to pour billions into R&amp;D if they know they'll get it all back and then some with a great new product.  All those European countries can let America invent the products and techniques, then start using them without any investment.  What do you think will happen if America goes socialist?  All those ""utopias"" of Europe will be in a pickle.  Suddenly you can't count on capitalist America do make the advancements, and you either need to raise taxes even more for R&amp;D or set medicine back decades.

And hey instead of blindly accepting stats, do research into them.  Yes, Americans have slightly lower life expectancy than some European countries.  But we have higher rates of accidental death through car accidents, drug overdoses, etc.  That has nothing to do with our healthcare system, we're just reckless people.  When you look at how good our doctors and hospitals are ,we're far superior.  We just die younger because we're fat rich idiots.  Some of it is unavoidable- were much bigger and more spread out so we drive more, therefore we die in car accidents more.  Some of it is stupidity- we're rich enough to eat whatever we want and not exercise, so we get heart disease and die younger, though the rest of the world is swiftly catching up to us in that regard.  The only thing you can really blame on policy is gun deaths, and most conservatives support some gun legislation, i.e. The mentally ill and criminals not getting guns.  In general with healthcare, if you have a job in America you're getting the best healthcare any country can offer.  And without us the world would suffer immeasurably in lost research.

Here's a question every liberal needs to answer.  I used to be super poor.  Like, had to dig through couch cushions to buy food.  I worked with rich people.  Had access to their homes.  Did I have the right, by virtue of being poorer than them, to steal what I wanted from their homes?  If not, why do you think it becomes moral when I have the government steal from them on my behalf?

And an additional question: how much to you trust your government?  Do you love going to the DMV and think public schools are better than private?  Do you think $500 on a toilet seat and $31k for a table is a reasonable price?  I don't.  Maybe you loved Obama with all your heart, but power changes every few years.  If you'd granted Obama authoritarian power, as soon as he's done Trump gets the same power.  So are you comfortable giving so much power to the federal government knowing your leader will change in a few years, and could be someone you totally disagree with?  Or would you prefer to limit federal power because you don't know who will come next?",1520159364.0,1,1,,False,0,False,False,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,2018,3,0.11450345

dva1biy,t1_dv97lxg,t3_82cxc6,MikeyPh,,"I generally agree with this sentiment, but it's a bit more complicated. Laws are on the books that slow down the process, laws that dictate appeals and other things, many of which I'm not that knowledgeable on. But lawyers are part of the problem.

One of the functions of lawyers from a philosophical standpoint is to test the law. They don't test it the way scientists do, they test it the way children test their parents, students test their teachers, or what we see in pretty much any other social relationship.

I don't mean to say lawyers are horrible when I say this, but lawyers are like rats that smell cheese. When defending someone in a case they are looking for any possible way in to their cheese, in this case it's getting their client off the hook. Maybe they can't get them off the hook entirely, then it becomes how low can they get the sentence, how many jailhouse perks can the get for a confession, how much they can get the client if they roll over on any accomplices, etc. In civil suits is all about how to pin the blame on someone and how much money you can extract from them. So they research the laws on the books, they see what precedents they can cite, they look for anything that might get their client off, that might extract more money, that might place the liability on a person or company, etc. Prosecutors do this, too, though often for less money (at least when it comes to the big cases).

Lawyers find any means to stay the execution, and sometimes that means appealing to the media and appealing to voters. It might not work in their particular case but it shows their client that they're doing as much as they possibly can.

The black population has so far suffered the highest price with severe reductions in life expectancy, crime and the collapsing economy. Although the end result will likely be the genocide of the white minority. The rand is headed from being superior to the US dollar to toilet roll grade. 

""Democracy"" or at least our fucked up idea of it destroyed Rhodesia. The black population saw their life expectancy half. Starvation. Cholera. 20,000 Matabele's were exterminated by NK trained death squads. Total collapse of the economy and currency from parity with the US dollar.

""Democracy"" put Allende in power in Chile. 

""Democracy"" put George Bush II in office. It put Obama in office. ""Democracy"" nearly put Hillary Clinton in office.

""Democracy"" could well put a far left lunatic even more dangerous than Bush II or Obama or Hillary in office. 

\*What exactly would you call the acts of mass murder perpetrated against minorities by Islamic state if not genocide? 

\*The Shia's have formed death squads and killed an untold number of Sunni's now that they have the means. Islamic state has drawn much support from the Sunni minority in Iraq because of this. I think the only thing that prevented them from running underground gas chambers is the ""Iraqi Security Services"" are corrupt, bickering idiots who couldn't organise a booze up in a brewery and are probably to busy sitting around in the sun smoking. 

\*Yes and we dealt with them and they were in no shape to invade anyone. We had returned the region to state of cold war between Iran and Saudi Arabia with a credible buffer between them. American policy supporting Saddam in his war against Iran likely emboldened him to invade Kuwait. He was hardly some kind of cartoon villain even if he was admittedly a very bad guy. I'm not a fan of Bush 41 by any means but his decision not to remove Saddam in 1991 was inspired and is the sign of a statesman. I can only assume Bush Jr took after his mother. 

The heavy lifting has been done by western special forces, Hezbollah, Iranian funded militias. We paid untold billions of dollars to create the Iraqi army. Paid a heavy price both in money and lives to train them and have them take over. They were armed with a vast array of modern weapons that countless other armies could only have dreamed of and the first thing they did was run away and leave them to the enemy. 

At this point the only option i see is to install a colonial administration in Iraq and recruit white officers and NCO's to run the army and combat units and trying to find a former Ba'athist general to be president and establish some sort of apartheid style system under which Iraq can be partitioned into a number of independent federal states to keep Sunni, Shia and Kurd happy.

Here’s a citation from an objective source:

https://www.thebalance.com/us-debt-by-president-by-dollar-and-percent-3306296

The president doesn't have much control over the debt added during his first year in office. The budget for that fiscal year was already set by the previous president.


Barack Obama: Under President Obama, the national debt grew the most dollar-wise. He added $8.588 trillion. This 74 percent increase was the fifth-largest. Obama's budgets included the economic stimulus package. It added $831 billion by cutting taxes, extending unemployment benefits, and funding public works projects.

The Obama tax cuts added $858 billion to the debt in two years. Obama's budget increased defense spending to between $700 billion and $800 billion a year. Federal income was down, thanks to lower tax receipts from the 2008 financial crisis. He also sponsored the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It was designed to reduce the debt by $143 billion over 10 years. But these savings didn't show up until the later years



So..... your issue with the debt seems to be related to Obama.  A 74% increase!!!

Trump has pulled the US our of trade deals and treaties that were not favorable to us.   I don’t know how you validate that he looks weak or isn’t carrying a big stick.

eppypos,t1_epoucoc,t3_bv1wy1,MojoHand052,Texas Conservative,"&gt;The DOJ has interpreted the memo to mean they cannot indict a sitting president. Mueller, working for the DOJ, was bound by that policy.

Again, find the specific language from the OLC memorandum that precludes a special council from accusing the president of a crime.  The entire contention here is over whether or not Mueller had sufficient cause, and hell, sufficient precedent to stick to the OLC ruling.  You have provided no substantive arguments other than ""hey look at Mueller's opinion on the OLC ruling,"" ignoring the plain fact that he was not, strictly speaking, bound to it.

&gt;Since they could not bring him to court, it would be unethical to accuse him. Accusing the president of a crime is not his job

This would all be news to Barr and Rosenstein, who both expected Mueller to reach a formal conclusion on the matter of obstruction.  It did not appear that the Attorney General expected the OLC ruling would prevent Mueller from making a decision, and I would say the AG is knowledgeable of such matters given that he ran the OLC for a time.

Coming to conclusions regarding whether a crime has been committed, or whether there is probable cause to charge the President, was in fact his job.  Stop hiding behind the OLC memorandum.  You don't understand it and you wouldn't like the specific circumstances in which it was concocted.

&gt;That process is impeachment. That is 100% the job of Congress, contrary to your statement.

No, what I was responding to was this suggestion that Mueller is 'handing things off to Congress,"" or that congress needed to pick up where Mueller left off.  If that's not what you're arguing, then I will drop it.

In any case, has Mueller made the job of Congress easier or more ambiguous by refusing to provide probable cause for a crime, and by failing to stipulate clearly whether the President had committed any such offenses?  Congress must now debate among themselves as to whether any of the 10 episodes of ""obstruction"" constitute criminal activity - which is not within their purview as a legislative body - and they must do this even though the DoJ has formally cleared Trump on criminal obstruction.

Congress is now in the backwards position of having to consider impeaching the president for behavior that is not formally criminal (*We can't accuse you of a crime until after we impeach you at which point we will accuse you of a crime*), contradicts the determinations of the DOJ, and is arguably within his powers as the chief executive officer.  It is no wonder then that the Democrats seem hesitant, despite their protestations, to initiate impeachment hearings.

&gt;As to your statement that nobody was charged with obstruction, I can only assume you do not understand that Obstruction of Justice covers a wide range of specific statutes. Michael Flynn, **Trump's National Security Advisor**, pleaded guilty to making false statements to investigators, a form of Obstruction of Justice. Konstantin Kilimnik, an associate of Paul Manafort, **Trump's Campaign Manager**, was indicted for witness tampering *at the request of Manafort*. Manafort himself was indicted on a number of charges. So your statement about people not being charged is pure fiction.

No one in Trump's administration was charged for obstruction insofar as it relates to the 10 'potential episodes of obstruction.'

&gt;Hot  on the heels of President Putins re-election victory, Donald Trumps leadership team is looking to All Russia's Peoples front for  advice on how to win.  
&gt;  
&gt; Andrey Yarin  who was the battleground-states director for Putins  campaign, has been sought out to speak to Trumps strategists on  Thursday, according to officials with the Trump campaign.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trumps leadership bid is being organized around much of the same strategic  goals that drove Putins victories in 2012 and this year — rallying  support from young people and other conservative-leaning voters who  haven’t traditionally cast ballots in elections.  
&gt;  
&gt;If  Trump wins, that is also the same approach he hopes to use to put the Republicans back on a competitive footing with the Democrats in 2016.

Holy fuck this is double standards to the max. You would be red in the face having a fucking  **aneurysm** from screaming if this was reversed.

A discussion about cnns town hall events 800 upvotes

A statement from a black reverend who says right wing race baiting wont work 22k upvotes

"" Mike bloomberg is full of shit and so is his surrogates"" 35.6k upvotes

All of that is a farcry from some of the shit i saw on T_D like saying that detriot is a shithole because of black people and that hiroshima bounced back while detroit decayed because of the blacks. I don't see shit like that on r/politics. they are legitimate newsworthy posts. Albeit overwhelming left wing. Maybe its because there are more left wingers active on social media? Whereas the majority of conservatives are well into the 50-90 age range?

For the 1% of screeching liberals that don't reason with the right and label all of the right as hitlers there is also 99% who understand your arguments and are willing to reason with you. They just don't talk in r/politics or r/worldnews because they know its just going to devolve into a hate bandwagon and that they will be downvoted into oblivion. Its kinda the same for right wingers. And it was the same for anyone who picked a fight with anyone from T_D. Although i wish admins would stick to their own rules more often unfortunately you cannot make conservative posts more popular there because its not upvoted enough for visibility. There are probably hundreds of right wing posts every hour they just languish with no upvotes because theres no snappy comment about trump or american greed to propel it to the top. Nothing gets people commenting more than trump hate or Brexit these days Because they are majorly polarising issues.

See my comments don't meld with your worldviews. Upvote right. Downvote left. Maybe i should start complaining now like you guys hurr durr im being downvoted that infringes my free speech fuck this right wing propaganda machine they're unfairly targeting me boohoo. Y'all know T_D was a cesspit that's why everyone's just downvoting me rather than trying to construct a defense. The only defense I've had is ""but this one sub doesn't like trump boohoo"" the entire world hates trump. That's not gonna change. Glad you got your upvotes for pointing out that all right wingers hate discussions that don't favour them labelling them as unfair. Whoop whoop you got your karma. Isn't that why you wont leave reddit but still log in to complain about it? Woohoo My 11 upwards arrows makes me feel validated in this conservative circle jerk.

Yea still no concrete defense as to why people who hate Reddit use Reddit
But this proved my point effectively. Once someone breaks the echo chamber they are downvoted into oblivion. its the same thing that happens to you guys in r/politics.

Everyone that's replied to me has said but do you see the shit that goes on in r/politics. Link me a post with a high upvote count that is racist from r/politics. I don't see shit. I see people who get downvoted when they don't follow the narrative like i am here right now apparently I've insulted everyone by saying T_D was a racist shit hole. Which it was

One defense so far ""we use ad blocker so the admins don't get money""
If you are doing that you are basically a thief. Just like torrent pirates. It may be a crime to tamper with digital services advertisements as that is their revenue stream. It may also go against the sites terms of service. its kinda scummy coming from the political group who are most vocal about people getting away with things for free.

The problem with voter id is, many people typically poor people in urban settings who don’t drive, don’t have a photo ID because they don’t need it. And people who are poor can’t afford to take a day off from work to go to a facility for a government issued ID (most likely DMVs which can be an hour+ away in some areas). Not only that, you have to pay for it, which having to pay for the right to vote is unconstitutional. The list goes on with problems with voter id.

Drops off broken laptops

Computer guy takes them

Hunter doesn’t pick them up

Computer guy says “well let’s go ahead and make a copy of this hard drive then load it up on another computer” (that’s what the original story said happened anyway)

So he transfers the hard drive, magically gets into hunter Biden’s emails, then does an apparent VERY specific word search to find highly incriminating emails from multiple years ago, all right before the election. Yeah dude totally. How many emails u think these people send daily? Bruh I would want to off myself thinking about going thru a political persons emails

Anyway, I’ve downloaded everything off of a hard drive and put it on a new computer before, I’ve never gotten immediate access to my social accounts, they’re always logged out between the transfer (maybe there’s a way to pull that information from the hard drive, but that’s far from a simple task)

I read the story a long time ago, but I recall it saying give or take “and he found all of hunter Biden’s emails on the hard drive”

Hunter Biden might be an idiot, he may be the dumbest person alive, but even the dumbest person alive would not go through the effort to take millions of emails off of their secure password protected email address (that saves all emails all without using hard drive space) and make copies of them, then attach them all directly to the hard drive. Further more Idt anyone dumb enough wanting to do that, wouldn’t possess the mental capacity to actually do it lol

I Think u actually need specific software to efficiently download emails, and if ur in his position, tf u got to gain by downloading emails to ur hard drive? He gonna blackmail himself? Lol Then he just abandon his laptops with all that crap on it at a repair store?

230c protects the *good faith* removal of obscene etc content.

If the service is maliciously removing content outside of those bounds, based on ideology or whatever, then 230 doesn't apply because they're acting in *bad faith*. You'd have to prove that in court, though, and 230 gives platforms a lot of latitude.

Very few of us would say that spam filters for email are bad, aside from the occasional false positive; however, similar filtering of YouTube videos would have people clutching pearls about censorship/""the algorithm""/etc.

The real problem is that there's little consensus on what counts as objectionable bullshit at the moment, not that platforms are exercising moderation of said bullshit (under the auspices of section 230).

The more insidious problem, in the US at least, is that the founders expected everyone to wear their big boy pants and actually think, but we have developed a nation of people who are enraptured by their echo chambers of choice. So the POV on what counts as bullshit is effectively diametrically opposed ideologically and actual truth is de-emphasized. This difference of opinion carries over to platform moderation, if for no other way than via the human beings doing it/coding it. 

We need a societal fix to compel everyone to pull their heads out our our collective asses, seek out *reliable* information, and then think critically on it.

Trump was able to get what he wanted done through Executive Order when the Legislature didn't cooperate. They didn't cooperate with him because he wasn't Establishment and both the Democrats and the RINOs didn't want to help him.

2. Have regular, good faith, discussions with people of other political affiliations to discuss how to craft functional policies (and insist our representatives facilitate similar discussions in public forums)
3. Stop dehumanizing immigrants (a vast majority of them are simply coming for what they believe will be a better life) coming here. Why? Because then feelings work their way into the discussions and then people will dig their feet in on both sides.

So? Why do you completely ignore the context around that? Nobody was going to mistake them for Biden's electors signed by the governor and that wasn't the point of them. It's totally dishonest for you to claim that was their intent when you know it clearly wasn't. The language you cited is nothing more than a legal formality in the wording taken from past examples in our history where this was done to challenge an election beyond the safe harbor deadline. The legal process to contest an election in this way is to have your own slate of competing electors that claim to represent the constitutionally qualified election result, and then congress and the state legislatures can decide whether to certify them or not. Otherwise they have nothing to certify even if they later agree Trump were the constitutionally qualified winner of the state (which literally happened in the Kennedy election in the 1960s, and at least two other times in US history prior to that).

It is so beyond dishonest to claim that it was a ""forged"" document when that's obviously not at all what it was and never in US history was it treated as such. It's an entirely new made up standard just for you to smear Trump.

> it's also a matter of fact that three states have already brought charges against

So? That's an argument from authority. All that tells you is that corrupt people hate Trump and his supporters and will do anything to punish them and keep him from power.

> and some have pled guilty including the architect of the scheme itself (Ken Chesebro)

People who are innocent will plead guilty when their options are a $5000 fine with no prison time vs. hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees with the possibility of life in prison decided by a hostile judge and jury filled with Trump haters.

Chesebro was also demonstrably NOT the ""architect"" of the process. That was John Eastman. You can literally go and rewatch the interviews and hearings in the state legislatures at the time and see it was always John Eastman. And despite the fact Eastman had every incentive to cave and turn on Trump, he never did and to this day still vehemently fights the false and completely fake charges against him and Trump.

Chesebro was only hailed as the ""architect"" by the media because he pleaded guilty and they could use him to smear Trump. He's a lifelong democrat and there's no shortage of establishment that positioned themselves in Trump's inner circle to undermine him, so that can't be ruled out either. In any case, argument from authority is not a convincing or valid argument, though it's all you have here.

> At least one of the MI Trump Electors declined to sign/participate and had to be replaced at the last moment because they were concerned they would be fraudulently and possibly criminally declaring that Trump had won the state fo MI

Ok? So? I would be scared of the weaponization of the justice system as well. Also there are plenty of people who are fraud deniers. I don't see how that is relevant.

> emails have revealed that the the Trump campaign called for 'complete secrecy' related to forming the slates of 'alternate electors'

lol what? They were literally on cameras in public hearings talking about it. Wasn't very secret haha. Perhaps they wanted to keep the details and names secret because anyone who challenged the election had their lives and livlihoods threatened... did you ever think of that?

Litreally your entire comment is one big argument from authority that is 100% against demonstrable truth. It is a fact this method was used to challenge elections before in US history and the legal precedent completely debunks your argument. It's also a fact that nobody would be ""fooled"" into confusing Trump's slate of electors with those certified for Biden, nor was that the intent (which obviously makes no sense!). Thus the legal use of ""fraud"" and ""forged"" here is completely improper and a blatant lie.",1704217966.0,1,0,,False,0,False,False,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,2024,1,0.15600902

kzqtffk,t3_1c4xjk5,t3_1c4xjk5,grimrigger,Conservative,"I don't think anyone really ""likes"" abortion, unless they're a sicko or fucked in the head.  I also think that you'll literally never ever get the 2 sides(pro-life vs pro-choice) to meet in the middle or compromise.  Essentially pro-choice don't believe that a fetus or at least a 5 month or less fetus is a human life.  The extreme pro-choice don't believe it's a human life even if the fetus is viable outside the mother's body.  On the other side, you have pro-lifers who believe that as soon as conception happens, it creates a human life.  And frankly, strictly scientifically speaking, they are right as a new organism with its own unique DNA is created.  But that new life is also completely dependent on another human to bring it along to where it would be viable on it's own, and at a significant physical and mental toll to the mother.

In any case, neither of these sides will ever agree.  They don't agree on the 1 fundamental point - when does human life begin?  I think all conservatives or people in general want individuals(women in this case) to have freedom over their bodies and medical choices....well at least until Covid happened, and then people from all walks of life decided to trample over individual rights and straight up act like flag waving Nazis as the ""unclean"" got loaded onto the rail cars(bye bye your job you've worked at for 20 years, bye bye access to public places you've paid for, hello constant admonishment and beratement for making an individual medical choice, hello non-stop censorship and refusal to allow debate).  Haha, you can see I am still very bitter about the Covid debacle and how I was treated and censored.

Back to the point...I don't like abortion and want to see less of it.  But I think Republicans that want to straight up ban abortion will consistently lose elections over it if they don't compromise.  I think trying to pass a federal law that outlaws abortion at 3 months, with some exceptions, has a chance to pass congress.  I think this is where most Americans can compromise on.  Get a bill through Congress that bans it at 10 or 12 weeks, and strongly advocate for adoption services or other help for young mothers that are considering abortion(heck even use federal dollars) and I think this is where society can finally move past this issue.  Even if we completely outlawed abortion....it would still happen behind the scenes almost assuredly.  Even if it didn't happen in illegal, covert clinics within the US, there would be political groups offering money for every woman to fly to Canada or wherever to go get one anyways. 

The best way forward is to encourage marriage through tax laws and social movements.  To stope encouraging promiscuity and sex to our young kids as normal behavior - bring shame back.  And seriously, for those women in tough spots who are considering abortion, offer them outlets like adoption....there are so so many couples who have waited too long to have children and would love to adopt to add to their family.  My wife and I would love to add a 3rd child, and so would many others.",1713218329.0,5,0,,False,0,False,False,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,2024,4,0.52139956
