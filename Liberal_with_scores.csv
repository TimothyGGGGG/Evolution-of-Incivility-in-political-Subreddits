Not exactly backing up the claims that millions are dying at the hands of US soldiers. 

Also, the ""flipping mercenaries"" you speak of aren't out in an active engaged war with Iraqis. There's only roughly 5000 private contractors for the entire country. They are mostly employed as glorified security guards for our interests there like our Embassy: http://www.npr.org/2011/12/27/144198497/no-u-s-troops-but-an-army-of-contractors-in-iraq . 

Granted 5000 is still a decent amount, but it nowhere near the 150,000 ground troops and 17,000 private contractors we had there before. It also cannot be stressed enough that they are not actively engaging in combat operations.

 Last week, two staffers who worked directly for Walker while he was county executive were charged with illegally doing political work while being paid by taxpayers to do county jobs.

 Walker has said that while he served as Milwaukee County executive, he had publicly and privately told county employees that it was improper to do political work while using county resources on county time.

 Walker said last week that if he had been aware of any other county employees doing political work with county resources on county time, he would have acted the same way he acted in the Wink matter.

c3rss6q,t1_c3rq9z9,t3_pr5m7,matts2,,"&gt;I'm not really sure what you mean by ""changing 1,000 laws"",

Child custody, inheritance, taxes, insurance mandates, etc. Can someone enter an existing marriage and if so are they treated differently than those already in the marriage? Similarly can one person leave or do you have to dissolve the entire marriage? There are 1,000+ places in the law where marriage is treated as between two people. There is only one place, at the definition, where we require marriage to have one man and one woman. I don't have any preference for any of the answers, I am saying that we have to answer these questions before we can go to group marriage.

200 years ago we could not have simply allowed gay marriage. At that time there was still tremendous gender bias. The law gave special rights and privileges to the husband. A man could own property in ways a woman could not as one example. Nor could you have gay divorce in a world where women tended to get alimony. Gay marriage is easy now in a large part because of a long effort to make the system without that gender bias. To go to group marriage requires that work.

&gt;I don't think that the government should be in the business of defining ""marriage"" at all. It's ridiculous for the government to be sanctioning certain relationships as being more ""official"" than others. 

No actually it is not. The relationship is real and part of how humans are. We are mostly but not exclusively pair bonding. Not all law is derived from some abstract first principles, plenty comes from setting up rules to reflect how things are.

That said, you actually give validity to the anti-gay marriage argument. You are actually trying to destroy marriage and trying to do a massive experiment on society.

&gt;The idea that one couple's relationship is more valid than another's just because the former couple went through certain arbitrary procedures in order to become ""married"" is just stupid.

What happens is that couples get certain rights and obligations from the public by engaging in some public ceremony. You don't understand or like it, fine. But to call a relationship that is universal among human societies stupid is, well, stupid. 

&gt;You say that legalizing polygamy would require changing too many laws(I'm assuming this also applies to bigamy), but how does that apply to incestual relationships? Shouldn't they be legal?

Sorry, but I don't see the connection. For the most party incest is disallowed because of the massive power imbalance involved. If there is some large group of people calling for changing those laws for themselves I would be open to listening. If this is just an abstract issue on your part I see no real world problem to deal with.

This would ensure that every rich scumbag gets hit and that no one can use loopholes to their advantage. I would further propose to reimburse any sales tax that would have been incurred on the first $20,000 ( Or an equivalent sliding-scale decile-based low dollar value) in income. 

Ex. You earn $20,000, assuming you spend what you earn, and assuming the 12% VAT, you would incur a tax of $2400 on your $17,600 in purchases. At the end of the year, you receive a check for $2400. This makes your earned income untaxed. Incomes less than $20,000 would have a prorated refund to yield a zero-tax outcome. 

For anyone making more than $20,000 that person/family would still receive that $2400 check, again making his or her first $20,000 untaxed.
This can also be sold to people as ""If you support this legislation EVERYONE will receive a check from the Federal government of up to $2,400 each and every year! You can count on it!""  The 50% of the country making less than $41,000 would see no increase in their Effective Tax Rate. In fact most in that bracket would see a decreased tax burden. 

Furthermore, When Warren Buffet has his Currently tax-free Foundation buy his Gulfstream Jet for $80,000,000 which is currently not subject to any income or capital gains tax, he will have to shell out $89.6 million, giving him a Jet and giving the Federal Government $9.6 Million Dollars... Which will fund the Federal Government for exactly 90.7 seconds.

Another Aspect of this is that it would mean effectively a $222Billion+ one-year interest-free loan to the Federal Government, every single year! This is based on rough calculations, but would be a low-end estimate.

Is that such a hard concept for you to understand? Why do you think germany has done well in europe over the past decade? It has nothing to do with government budgets, it had a bigger deficit and a larger debt than spain in 2007. Germany did so well because capital flows out of the country kept wages in check and inflation lower than the rest of the eurozone. That enabled it to maintain a trade surplus corresponding to the rest of the eurozones trade deficit. 

So, are you opposed to manufacturing recovery we've had in this country? You realize that the only successful models of recovery from the global recession involve aggressive monetary policy and a recovery in the industrial sectors of the economy, right?

And not only that, but our current account deficit is an indication that the dollar is over valued. Even if the fed didnt increase the monetary base, a country with a current account deficit is eventually going to see a decrease in the value of its currency so that that the deficit self corrects. 
 
&gt;You would also not mind it costing Americans more to travel or buy ANYTHING imported(which includes gas and oil)? 

Devaluation both increases foreign investment in the US, and encourages US consumers to buy domestic. Both will encourage the move back to full employment. The dollar has been devalued to some extent, oil is under $100 and CPI has remained constant, even occasionally below the feds 2% target. You would think that once your economic school of thought has been wrong on every single prediction its made since 2008, you would rethink your ideas of how economics work. Apparently not with austrians.

&gt;Inflation, expanding credit, massive public debt, deficit spending, and unbalanced budgets are all just fine too, I guess? Basic Keynesian approach, right?

Pretty much. We've already discussed inflation. You simply dont have a firm understanding of it. The monetary base has tripled, why hasnt there been massive inflation? It's because the economy is not at full output, think [basic AS/AD model.](http://images.wikia.com/centralecon/images/a/a8/320as%26ad.jpg) Besides, from what i read from austrians, inflation is irrelevant in your mind. The only thing bad about it is that it causes a redistribution of income. With an overhang of private sector debt, that makes total sense. We should increase inflation to chip away at private sector debt in real terms. 

And when it comes to budget deficits and government debt, you have even less of a grasp of how it works. [The governments budget deficit is the just the flip side of the private sectors surplus + the capital account surplus.](http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-02-03/markets/29993505_1_sector-budget-surplus-budget-deficit) Is your grasp on national accounting identities really that bad? Eliminating the deficit right now isnt only a bad idea, its probably not possible. Ask greece how austerity can be self defeating. Cutting government spending is just going to worsen the economy. Ron Paul says he'll decrease government spending by a trillion dolalrs in a single year. What do you think is going to happen to the economy if that happens? And please, tell me how government borrowing just crowds out private sector investment. I would love to educate you on actual economics. 

Besides, why would you be panicking about the deficit when the bond market is obviously not. Rates on 10 year notes are at record lows, and even below inflation. Not only does that suggest that the bond market is entirely confident in the governments ability to pay off its debts for at least the next 10 years, but the fact that the rate is below inflation suggests that investors are afraid to put their money anywhere else. Theyre willing to take a loss in real terms. 

&gt;A currency devaluation is in order in their case because it is the only way to secretly drop the wages of the overpaid citizens.

Over paid? By what standards? The government doesnt even involve itself in wages, its an agreement between unions and their employers. Who are you to claim that the citizens are overpaid when their employers obviously dont feel the same way. You realize that devaluation is going to impact the employer in the same way that it impacts the employee, right? It isnt going to make it cheaper for domestic producers to hire.

And this is hilarious. Before it was a horrible idea for the government to restore competitiveness through devaluation, and now its the only way for it to be accomplished. 

&gt;Unions pressure government for devaluation so they dont have to lower wages, and government officials like it because it lowers unemployment in the short term.

You think the unions are the ones that would lobby the government for devaluation? You have convoluted basic economics and even recent history in order to support your claim. 

Before, you claimed the government had to use devaluation to secretly restore competitiveness so as not to upset the overpaid workers, and now you're claiming that union is the one asking for devaluation? You're stretching reality so much to try to have a valid argument and in doing so you've come to two completely contradictory conclusions within a single paragraph. Congratulations, you've achieved cognitive dissonance on an impressive scale. 

&gt;Currency devaluation used without price controls is extremely dangerous in the long run, and doubly so in a global economy such as the US. 

*Citation needed

&gt;The positive effects are short lived due to an adjustment phase.

Oh my god the simplistic understanding that austrians have of inflation is so hilarious to me. You realize that the fed doesnt just drop money from a helicopter, right? Buying long term government debt can bring down long term interest rates, which encourages economic growth. Its not as simple as more money = more demand. But i wouldnt expect some murray rothbard disciple to understand that. 

&gt;In the US it would also be a giant gift to China, because we are in debt up to our eyeballs with them.

Right...Because its not like china only owns 12% of our debt or anything. And how is currency devaluation a gift to china? You're mixing up monetary and fiscal policy. Currency devaluation means that if we owe china a trillion dollars, and we devalue the dollar, that $1 trillion is now worth less than they expected. It is *fiscal* stimulus that could be taken as a gift to china, because we would be in debt more and paying them interest. Devaluation is robbing our bond holders, and the fact that you arrived at the opposite conclusion just further proves my point that you really have absolutely no economic background what-so-ever. 

But really, you have just shown a horribly simplistic understanding of economics. ",1337485653.0,1,0,,1337604914,0,,,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2012,5,0.103494145

That social contract enables the US government to do nasty mean crap like that.

c606fkt,t1_c605p86,t3_yytmg,The_Finglonger,,"&gt;The mother has that same choice. Giving birth is life threatening, it should be her choice if she wants to go through with it. Abortion is safer than birth. It's almost self defense if you will, against someone who is inside the mother against her will, demanding her resources, her blood, and demanding that she risk her life to save them.

I find this a rather compelling argument for abortion when rape is involved.  I could possibly agree with this, as i said in another response (if the mother becomes suicidal due to the pregnancy, it may be better to abort, as a last resort)  I think calling it self-defense would imply immanent suspected loss of life, however, and i disagree with that.  If there's merely a 'chance' of death, albeit a small one, than the risk should be taken for the possibility of preserving life.  it's an unwelcome risk, but we face unwelcome risks every day, and isn't new life a worthwhile reward for this minor risk?

If we take your position and apply it to self defense laws, it would mean that if a guy punches me in the gut, possibly causing internal bleeding (though i don't know for sure), would i be justified to pull out a gun and shoot him in the head, to avoid another punch?

&gt;Until it is conscious, it is not a person in my opinion, it is merely a potential person

So your argument means that someone who's child was in a coma when born, due to a temporary medical condition, can be terminated as well?
What if they went into a coma 2 days after being born?  where is the line there?

&gt;I see an egg and a sperm separate as a human life too

How close do they have to be to be considered a human life to you?  2 inches?  4 feet?  If I have phone-sex with someone, and sperm is flushed down the toilet and the egg is released during menstration, was that ending life?  I don't think anyone would think that, besides you.  Those two independent things have no potential to become life without combining.  If you pour the vodka and OJ down the drain separately, you didn't pour a screwdriver down the drain, you pour vodka and OJ.

&gt;as medical technology improves that line will decrease

And because laws keep up with the development of science so well, we won't be ""killing people"" for very long, until 28 becomes 27, then 27 becomes 26, and so on. I think of the chaos around patent law right now on the front page, shows the danger in this logic.  Letting the supreme court decide who is a ""who"" is just giving up a decision to a few old men and women.  Shouldn't medical science be the deciding factor in this regard, not ex-lawyers?

&gt;Pre-fetal viability abortion is no different to me than using a condom and not getting pregnant one month

Even though using a condom and not getting pregnant never starts a biological chain of events that can lead to another human's existence?
Please, also, explain how you can believe this when it's common to provide counseling to women who had miscarriages much earlier than this ""viability"" line?  Why do these women need counseling if there is no belief that the lost ""cluster of cells"" was a life?

Finally, the thing i'm trying to understand is this ""cherishing of life"" that is often a charge of a liberal mindset seems to only apply when it doesn't inconvenience.  It's still interference, regardless of the ""viability"", etc...

c6s8uhz,t1_c6s4mj5,t3_124k9g,spotta,,"Since you are just getting flamed, I'll try to give a reasoned response to some of your points:

Concerning the debt:

I think you have some misconceptions about the evils of the national debt.  The first thing to keep in mind is that governments (specifically the US government) don't have the same problems with debt that individuals have.  The debt isn't nearly as bad as you seem to believe, and is actually a separate issue from Social Security and Medicare.

However, I do understand your concern about the debt.  The problem is that Romney is much less likely to reduce the debt.  His current [tax plan](http://www.mittromney.com/sites/default/files/shared/the_romney_program_for_economic_recovery_growth_and_jobs.pdf) is to: reduce the direct income taxes by 20%, reduce corporate tax rates, and then attempt to make up the difference by closing tax loopholes (he calls it ""broadening the tax base"").  The biggest problem with his plan is twofold:  he is reducing taxes a lot (I think it is ~ $500 billion, or $5 trillion over the next 10 years).  He claims that by removing tax loopholes he can make up the difference, but he hasn't released any information about what loopholes will allow him to make up such a huge difference.  He also wants to increase military spending by $2 trillion over the next 10 years, which is also a lot, and will need to be paid for.

[Obama](http://www.barackobama.com/plans/taxes-budget) wants to decrease military spending, cut taxes to the middle class, raise taxes on the rich (to Clinton levels), cut taxes for small businesses, and create tax credits for companies that keep jobs in the US.

While on the one hand, he hasn't done that yet, on the other hand at least his plan involves more fiscally sane policies.  I am more afraid of Romney getting his plan than Obama not getting his.

Concerning Unemployment:

Romney's plans to combat unemployment involve: actually I couldn't find them.  His jobs plan is a ""I'm not Obama, and this combined with my tax cuts and lower corporate tax rates will raise create 200-300 thousand new jobs a month"".  I'm not so sure this is a sane plan.  12 million new jobs are projected to be created by the economy on it's own, regardless of who wins the election: [here](http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/economy/247081-experts-say-economy-should-grow-despite-who-wins-white-house-in-november).

Concerning Congress:

While it is the jobs of a leader to bring people together, it is also the job of congress to compromise.  To lay this entirely on Obama isn't really fair, and to reward this kind of behavior (to elect a republican into the presidency) I think is wrong.

&gt; The security guards at the compound in Benghazi were in cell phone contact with the State Department in real time describing the attack. There were email and other descriptions sent to the White House in real time.

[Here's a timeline of the attacks](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444620104578008922056244096.html). The initial firefight was over after about an hour and a half. US security reinforcements were scrambled; however, by the time they were prepped, deployed, and arrived, the initial fighting had ceased and the Ambassador was MIA/KIA. Unless your uncle is suggesting that we should have bombed the consulate ourselves, he fails to indicate that the US did not follow proper protocol regarding the attacks. For what it's worth, Benghazi is roughly 630 mi away from Tripoli and 504 mi from Sicily. 

&gt; Shortly after the attack, the State Department staff deemed Ansar al Sharia’s claim of responsibility for the attack on social media credible enough to report it to the White House, etc.

No. It was reported to the White House because it was the *first lead* in an ongoing investigation. 

&gt; Terrorist groups use social media to plan and claim responsibility for terrorist attacks. That's why the CIA monitors their social media. 

There are a few things wrong with this assertion. Transnational Terror Groups use social media for self promotion or as marketing. **Social Media is insecure communication; it is rarely, if ever, used in order to plan and coordinate attacks.** Intelligence organizations monitor them *just as they monitor all other open sources of communications from known enemy combatants.* 


&gt; The State Department staff wouldn’t forward frivolous material to the White House, CIA, etc. if they didn’t place a lot of weight on it.

See above; it was the first lead in an ongoing investigation. Intelligence agencies, included SDI, have doubled down their efforts to share information with one another in order to streamline communication. This is one of the few positives to come from the USA PATRIOT Act. 

There was, in reality, no way to determine what was and was not frivolous in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Intelligence agencies were and are still sorting through copious amounts of information in order to determine how, why, and by whom this attack actually occurred. Furthermore, Ansar al Sharia rescinded their confession shortly thereafter. 

&gt; The CIA station chief in Libya determined within 24 hours of the attack that it was the work of terrorists, so the question is why the White House continued claiming that the video was to blame.

And internally the WH was referring (and responding) to it as a terrorist attack as well. Regardless, here is an excerpt from the Ansar al Sharia confession:

&gt; Ansar al-Shariah Brigade didn't participate in this popular uprising as a separate entity, but it was carrying out its duties in al-Jala'a hospital and other places where it was entrusted with some duties. The Brigade didn't participate as a sole entity; rather, it was a spontaneous popular uprising in response to what happened by the West.

So, from the intelligence received it appears to have been carried out by *some* members of a terrorist organization, in response to the video. In conjunction with the number of demonstrations around the Middle East that had been a specific result of the video, it is no wonder the it was externally classified as having been the result of the video. 

Furthermore:

c78n1bd,t3_13z65x,t3_13z65x,dpetric,,"To me, one of the most pressing issues facing our nation is the enormous gap between those with the most wealth and the rest of us. I know these facts and figures get tossed around a lot but I do not think it’s a good thing for society, overall, when:

The share of total income in America going to the top 1% of American households (also after federal taxes and income transfers) increased from 11.3% in 1979 to 20.9% in 2007. [Source]( http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42729).

And

From 1992 to 2007 the top 400 earners in the U.S. saw their income increase 392% and their average tax rate reduced by 37%. [Source]( http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/02/income-inequality-in-america-chart-graph).

And perhaps most distressingly:

As of 2010, the top 1% of households (the upper class) owned 35.4% of all privately held wealth, and the next 19% (the managerial, professional, and small business stratum) had 53.5%, which means that just 20% of the people owned a remarkable 89%, leaving only 11% of the wealth for the bottom 80% (wage and salary workers). [Source]( http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html)

My greater point is that I believe that society works best when we all have a greater stake in it. I do not believe that we should prevent people from acquiring a lot of wealth, or actively seek to impede those who try. However, the enormous concentration of wealth at the top creates many problems for the “average middle class person.”

Here’s a short list of ways I think that our wealthiest citizens exert more power on our society than everyone else:

1. Due to the current state of campaign funding the wealthiest have a disproportionate voice in our Democracy. It’s hard to refute that had Newt Gingrich been elected president, he would not have been beholden, at least in some small part, to his primary benefactor Sheldon Adelson – who, between he and his wife, gave the Gingrich campaign a combinded $10M [Source]( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/us/politics/sheldon-adelson-a-billionaire-gives-gingrich-a-big-lift.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0). This is distressing to me.

2. In the same vein – the current state of lobbying by moneyed interest groups lock those without money (and consequently) power out of the political process. Why would your local Representative listen to you – who may give $50-$100 to his campaign during the next election cycle when the various powerful lobbying groups will donate/withhold x10 that amount?

3. I believe that we live in a society that rewards those that already have money (and power) and at the same time makes it very hard for the most vulnerable among use to improve themselves. Once you acquire vast riches, it is easy to make your money work for you – just look at Mitt Romney’s tax returns for evidence of this. The man was technically unemployed – save for some speaking fees – yet still earned 10M+ from returns on investments. His money earned him money. This is a luxury that not many of us are privilege to because the majority of our incomes are spent on stuff that allows us to get by. Car loans, mortgages, food, bills, childcare etc. It is especially hard for our poorest citizens to save for the future, invest, plan ahead when an even greater proportion of their incomes are spent on meeting basic needs. This feeds into another discussion on crime and poverty – but I also believe that the system is such that our poorest citizens are placed in a position that does not reward long term investments (ie planning) – and rewards focus on immediate gratification. This type of culture leads to a lot of the problems we see with crime, drug, abuse, children born into broken homes etc – most prevalent among the lower class. Why should I save for college, when I may not even live until I am 23?

You ask is it “right” to “make” our most wealthy citizens give more, to help our most vulnerable citizens. Yes, I do believe that it’s right. Many on the right will say that it’s the place of charities/religious organizations/non-profits to assist in the way I propose. While I agree that those organizations do have their role, I believe that some problems are so big – that Government must intervene. I think this is largely what this mini discussion on economic issues boil down to: “Do you believe that Government can be used a force of institutional/moral good?” Yes, I believe it can, and must – if we are to ever repair the countries deepest problems.

c7o2t01,t3_15n2xa,t3_15n2xa,Mentalpopcorn,,"&gt;Free abortions mean there is no repercussions to being careless and will continue to cost taxpayers

Cost is not the only disincentive to abortion.  The procedure is painful and uncomfortable and not something any woman would want to go through twice.  Most women don't want to go through it once.  There is also the matter of being ostracized from your community and called a slut/whore/whatever. 

The other fault in the reasoning rests upon the idea that there is reason to believe that cheap/free abortion would lead to ""irresponsible"" behavior.  This is an empirical statement and thus requires empirical evidence and I'm almost positive the aforementioned conservative gentleman does not possess said evidence.  We really have no data to suggest that people are more careless when abortion access is cheap/free, but it contains an element of ""common sense"" and so people believe it. 

We've really just identified the crux of many conservative arguments; some prima facie reasonable sounding claim is used as a premise for a much wider conclusion and we generally don't bother challenging whether the claim is actually true, but rather accept the claim and attempt to argue the conclusion.

Another example:

""Lower taxes on the rich mean higher economic productivity"" - this is a reasonable sounding claim because basic econ tells us that taxes lower output.  It's a basic enough idea that most people have no problem accepting it when applied inappropriately.  In fact it's not true according to the data.

In other instances data is applied inappropriately.  For instance, one could take a survey finding that abortions increase after being made cheaper/free and conclude that cheaper abortions lead to higher rates of promiscuity, but this conclusion would not be supported by the data.  It would be expected that abortions would increase when made more available but this would more likely indicate that people who were previously denied abortions were able to get them, thus increasing abortion rates.  

My last argument would be that women who need abortions need abortions and it would be unethical to deny access to those in need even if cheaper/free abortions lead to promiscuity.  There's no sense in punishing people medically to stop some other perceived immoral effect.

These arguments all rest, of course, on the idea that abortion is itself wrong, but the scientific data tells us that until a certain point a fetus is not sentient enough to feel pain or have thoughts.  It's hard to condemn abortions at these early stages unless one accepts something like a soul, a premise for which there is no evidence, of course.",1356837867.0,1,0,,False,0,,,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2012,12,0.3389984

Farms have had to close down due to regulations by the EPA. Businesses were unable to open due to federal regulations. Businesses were closed down due to costs of federal regulations. In fact, due to the ACA, many people are losing their jobs. This is the cost of regulation in its most massive form. Where do you think the ""Fiscal Cliff"" came into play?

I believe the law should be originated and kept at the lowest level of government (city/county, depending on population). These laws should reflect the views of the people. The state government should keep its nose out of discouraging businesses and employment. The federal government should keep its nose out of the states.

The author then proceeds to inform the reader in a condescending and unscholarly tone that the book in question could not possibly be true, as guns did in fact exist in early America. Some of them were even used. Whether intentional or not the author of this blog seems to be incorrectly conflating gun culture and gun ownership, the stark difference to which anyone who has ever known both a gun owner and a gun nut will testify.

c8n8c89,t1_c8mc00e,t3_19aq86,[deleted],,"A common misunderstanding is the distinction between assault rifles and ""assault weapons"". An assault rifle can be automatic and were banned under the NFA in the 80's. Neither Adam Lanza or Holmes used assault rifles. They used ""assault weapons""

What is an ""assault weapon""?  It is NOT automatic but semi-automatic  It is functionally no different and no more lethal than your grandfather's hunting rifle.  The term ""assault weapon"" was made up by politicians in 1994 to label particular modern sporting rifles in a scary way in order to get them banned. They look aesthetically similar to automatic weapons but that's where the similarities end.  If you changed the outside of a Toyota Carolla or Honda Civic to look like a Ferrari, those cars would not be able to drive 190 mph - they'd still be a Honda Civic's engine, etc but just look like a Ferrari. The same applies to Ar15s looking like automatic weapons

But aren't those ar-15s being used by spree shooters? Yes, but that's largely due to the popularity of this firearm in my generation. I am hardly a hayseed from East Bumblefuck, Alabama. I'm a professional in a major city, yet 6 of my friends own ar-15s. That is a testament to it's popularity. Its kind of like how call of duty is blamed since many spree shooters play it. Well yeah, it's probably the most popular game in my generation so it's likely they would. Would you blame that?  If teenagers were most commonly dying in car wrecks due to speeding and almost all of those happened in red camaros would we ban red camaros while leaving other functionally and mechanically similar cars alone?

There's just so much misinformation and disinformation out there. During the Feinstein gun hearings yesterday, someone actually blamed ar-15s for columbine, the giffords shooting, and Virginia tech even though none of those shooters used assault weapons. The most deadly was Virginia tech which involved pistols with low capacity magazines. He simPly reloaded repeatedly. Same with the columbine kid

As for the ""they only had muskets"" argument: the supreme court found that civilians are allowed to carry whatever firearms are in common use and bring utilized by the military at that time as per the founders' idea that the civilian population constitutes the militia.   In fact, men were expected to bring their own firearms if they fought in a battle.  ""Well-regulated"" meant to have trained and proficient shooters - regulation did not have the same meaning as it does today.  At the time of the constitution, they believed that firearms empowered the civilian population and kept the centralized government in check.  The second amendment was not for skeet shooting or huntin or self defense. The second amendment is to prevent and challenge tyranny. Some view that as ridiculous today but tell that to the Viet Cong or the Afghanis who repelled both the Ussr and US. If you have an issue with the second amendment, theN change it legally through an amendment process, but don't undercut it through unconstitutional avenues.

And (this is an assumption, but likely the case) it should never have been taught/allowed that the boy could play with it casually, as a ""toy"", when not in use.

The racism thing is such a double standard its getting old now. Just admit that its ok for non-whites to say racist things about whites. I feel that people call someone racist so easily when in reality they mean stereotyping which is not racist. Like white people can't dance, not racist, a stereotype. Black people like watermelon, stereotyping not racism.

If I disagree with Obama, not racist, just have a different opinion. There is a huge difference between racism, feeling one race is superior to another, and stereotyping which is making deductions based on generalizations of a group of people.

&gt;Do you know what the definition of a traitor is? Your stupid statement makes it pretty obvious you don't. A traitor is someone who commits treason by betraying his country.

actually, from [this](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/traitor) site and [this](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/traitor) site, a traitor is also defined as someone who betrays a cause. So I'm pretty sure you dont know what exactly a traitor is.

A passionate man that has convictions, but then the same man that stumbles on his own words as he tries to justify what he has done. Has Obama technically broken the law? No. Is the law that gives the executive branch the NSA a violation of the constitution? I would say yes.  

&gt;Congress passes laws that created and continue the NSA. Obama can't ignore those laws.

Youre right he cant. But he can speak out against them, he can talk to the American people and tell us whats going on. Tell the people to tell their representatives to get rid of the NSA. And if that doesnt help, well then Obama would have done his part. The blood would be on our hands.  

&gt;What's so preciously important about the list of telephone numbers you call, which aren't even linked to you by name? Why is your ""privacy"" of that list more important than protecting people from being blown up by bombs here in the streets?(By the way the US Supreme Court said more than 30 years ago you have no right to privacy in the lists of phone numbers you call and that list is not protected by the 4th Amendment.)

Well I dont believe for a second that our telephone numbers arent linked to our names. The government is merely trying to minimize what they are really doing.

A frequent meme is calling each other ""racist"" with a sarcasm tag in response to any post dealing with race.

To be fair, I actually thought that all this focus on black people and race issues had a strange vibe of underlying racism-in-denial.

Not necessarily, but you have to remember, there are lots and lots of people who have way too much money, and giving them more money doesn't necessarily cause them to consume more.  One thing doesn't necessarily follow the other, but I'll concede the point because it's irrelevant.

&gt;Do you dispute that virtually every modern material and virtually every service is fossil fuel powered today?

This is basically accurate, but again, for one, giving people the power to consume more resources doesn't necessarily follow that they are going to consume more resources, not to mention that even while consumption taxes wouldn't strictly need to exist (while many shouldn't, for example, regressive consumer gasoline taxes), they very well could and probably should.  The highest ideal would be a state controlled marketplace for these resources, but in the system we have, consumption taxes are the way to allocate resources fairly.

cbg1o1h,t1_cbfq8k6,t3_1jifn0,joshthegrave,,"I understand the argument but it's just based on too many broad assumptions for me to consider it the least bit fair. I worked as an unskilled laborer for a quite a while when I was young and fit, and could easily outwork someone twice my age, much less 3 times my age. How is it fair to me if a portion of the money that I worked hard to make for the company goes to someone else just because they're older than me?

&gt;The priorities of a 60 year old would be much more mature and oriented towards a family, and grandchildren at that age.

This is an assumption. I worked with plenty of unskilled laborers that were pretty old with immature priorities and nobody depending on them. They worked those jobs just because they were simple, not strictly supervised, had no dress code, and didn't drug test. I'm by no means saying that this is the majority, but it happens enough that it would have really pissed me off if their pay was scaled higher just because they were older than me. 

Why not cut to the chase and just make businesses pay employees a portion of the profits, perhaps even tied to employee productivity? That mixed with a cap on how much more the top paid person can make relative to the bottom and a liveable minimum wage, seems like a much better solution than something as arbitrary as age. Especially in the unskilled labor force, where being young and fit makes you much better at the job. 

&gt;Likewise, it's only fair that a woman with children makes more than us because she has mouths to feed. 

I'm sorta playing devil's advocate here because obviously I do think single mothers should make enough to feed their children, but once again how is this fair? It doesn't seem like I'm responsible for her having kids before she was financially capable of supporting them. Also it seems like the burden still falls on me, and not the business. Instead of giving money to the government via taxes, and them giving it to her; I just don't get as much on my paycheck as she does. So it's not really less money from the tax payers. I'm still essentially paying for it, just with my labor instead of my money.

&gt;The image was of that crying ""leave brittney alone"" kid and I pulled it straight from google images. You know all of this is true but you continue to lie because lies, comic books and pervy tattoos are all you have, being none too bright.

Yup, that's the image but you're lying again because Google Images does not have that file in it's index for davidduke.com because of the robots.txt file that prevents Google's index system from searching the directory. The image is not in Googles search index which means you had to know exactly where the file was located (ya know... on david.com) or copy and paste the link from a place where the URL is commonly used. The only place I've found it being used it by you and on Stormfront.org 

You keep making up this ridiculous story that simply is untrue. If it were true you'd be able to provide a link to the Google Image search page where it appears. Go ahead Bigot, post the link. 

&gt;And, as you also know perfectly well, the so-called Stormfront story was a story about Israel's brutal treatment of Africans, which I posted from the very mainstream site http://thenational.ae/ - which you claim I got from Stormfront although you had no real evidence. BTW I imagine Stormfront reprints a lot of mainstream stories but I'm not sure, since I've never been to Stormfront.

Even my sister's ex, a staunch conservative who was in the marines and served two tours in Iraq has come to see our wars there as counterproductive. the only reason 9/11 really happened in the first place was that we pissed these people off and they wanted to retaliate. Had we not been over there in the first place then these two stupid wars, the Patriot Act and all this other shit wouldn't be an issue.
Most of what we did was a disaster. 

However, it is clear that there has been a need to have a strong military in the past. Recent Society roadmaps showed that the Soviet Unions was planning attacks against both the United States and Manchester in the UK. Bear in mind these were uncovered long after the war so they were probably not manufactured for some propaganda purposes and they are published in overseas newspapers like the Guardian. Britain did take an anti-communist approach, but that was only after an ambassador was killed in London. However, the fact that the Soviets were apparently planning to strike Britain when they weren't even at war shows they did seem to have a thirst to take over the world. Even if they didn't want to attack the United States you can't argue that other countries didn't need a military to protect themselves, because they were clearly invaded without provocation. What would have happened if we didn't have a strong enough military to deter them? There are a lot of records saying that the Soviets wanted to take over the world. Of course, a lot of it was probably propaganda to get support for the war effort, but a lot of it sounds credible and aligns with Stalin's desire to spread communism.


&gt;Nazi Germany? I've never read any historical account giving credibility to the idea that Hitler might have marched himself across the ocean, landed on our shores among our people, and established oppressive military rule over us if we hadn't gone in for the butt-kicking like we did. Taking over a country the size and scope of the USA is not like taking over Poland. Even if we had no military to defend us, it would require tremendous resources for a country to take us over and even more resources to maintain and preserve their power if they managed to do it. It wouldn't be worth it, we're too big and too far away from home base.

Well historically speaking you are wrong. Keep in mind that you are thinking like a rational human being. Megalomaniac tyrants like Hitler, while brilliant in some ways are also often insane. He wasn't thinking rationally at all. Here is some background on his plot to strike the United States long before we ever considered involving ourselves in the war. In fact, we made a point to stay out of it but Hitler still wanted a piece of us. Granted part of the reason he wanted to attack was that he blamed the U.S. for the allies winning in the first world war, but that a lot of that was misinformation (as was others that believed it). Despite the fact that we wanted to remain neutral he saw us as a threat to his campaign for world domination. REgardless of his reasons he was planning to attack and we would have been fucked if we didn't have plans to defend ourselves.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerika_Bomber
http://hnn.us/article/32084

&gt;To overcome these practical obstacles Hitler built up the German navy and began work on a long-range bomber -- the notorious Amerika Bomber -- which would be capable of flying to New York and back without refueling. Although the bomber proved difficult to construct, Hitler embarked on a crash building program of superbattleships promptly after the defeat of France. In addition, he began accumulating air and sea bases on the Atlantic coast to facilitate attacks on the United States. In April 1941 Hitler secretly pledged that he would join Japan in a war on the United States. This was critical. Only if Japan declared war would Germany follow.


&gt;In other words, our military has never ""protected our freedom"" because our freedom was never threatened by a military enemy, only by internal enemies more likely to use the military to take our freedom than protect it.

The truth is that most of the world doesn't want to fuck with us because largely because of our strong military. Arguing that we don't need our military because nobody has attacked us is circular logic if the military itself is one of the biggest reasons they didn't want to. A military doesn't need to defend by firing a shot. Sometimes its mere presence is enough to keep would-be invaders at bay. History is full of psychopathic dictators and it certainly isn't feasible to ignore their existence.

My take is that we certainly need a military to defend us if we are ever attacked. However, it is a bit ironic that we call it the Department of Defense when almost everything we have done as of late is stir up trouble in other countries that haven't provoked us. The military should be there to protect us and our allies not spread our power all over the world. I do think that it is absurd that the same people who whine about needing to be fiscally responsible throw a hissy fit when we talk about cutting the military when we are already spending six times more than any other country on earth, two and half times that of all of Europe (despite having a much smaller population) and nearly half that of the entire world.",1384715302.0,1,0,,1384716345,0,,,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2013,11,0.5024724

Remember, the Euro's not doing great with the austerity, so Europe's a little squishy there.

Haha.  Just because they say they are going to ""adjust"" the levels doesn't mean a taper.  I predict one of two things.  1, They will boost QE to 100b or 150b, claiming that the economy just needs a little jolt to climb out of this depression.  2, That they bring it down to 60b for about 2-3 months then up to 150b after that.

The economy can't handle a taper at this point, and the only way the fed can keep interest rates artificially low (which is actually hurting real savings and growth) is to keep the presses humming.

&gt;You came here defending a guy that has gone on record as saying we're going to be under martial law cause China's going to sink the dollar.

I hadn't heard this.  Source? I do know that the PBOC is [no longer purchasing treasuries](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-20/pboc-says-no-longer-in-china-s-favor-to-boost-record-reserves.html) which will have an effect on the treasuries market for sure, meaning the FED will just buy those treasuries that China stops buying.

&gt;That's kinda eye-rollingly paranoid on one level, but also colossally inept on a financial level. China's doing some sketchy shit with currency, but it's to keep the Yuan low.

Paranoia is a funny thing, the people who claim others are paranoid are always caught unaware and flabbergasted when they are proven wrong.  For example the ""tin-foil"" hat wearers that were saying the NSA was up to no good long before it made the news.  But they were just nutty, right?

As for keeping the Yuan low, I think China will let the value rise, now that they have decided to stop buying our debt.  It is in their interest to have a strong Yuan right now after all.  I don't predict Martial Law in our near future, frankly the Chinese wouldn't need to fire a shot to turn us on upside down at this point.

&gt;As a woman, bringing a kid to an interview literally destroys your chances. All the boss sees is someone who is unreliable and will not hire.

First off, your comment should say PERSON. This is only a problem for females? 

Guess what? there are far more things you will be judged on than just bringing your kids. If your merit is slam dunk, I bet money a boss could work with the inconvenience. In this case, she left children in no way old enough to fend or even think for themselves. 

I am a business owner, that boss you speak of. But guess what i won't do, judge someone for having to bring their kids to an interview. You know what I will judge? If those kids are not well behaved, because you can tell A LOT about a person by the behavior of their children.

&gt;Its like condemning a woman who steals food to feed her children.

Well, stealing is stealing and it is wrong regardless of the circumstances. I condemn any PERSON who steals. This is why we have programs available through community outreach and churches, which subsequently exists for women who need a little help so they can leave their children to go to a job interview.

ALSO, This has nothing to do with women or men, stop using that as an point of debate.

As to why bussers and hostesses make so little is because it is a job usually done by young teens and highschoolers who can't serve alcohol because of their age.   Also there is little skill required in those positions.

&gt;The history of the scientific discovery of climate change began in the early 19th century when ice ages and other natural changes in paleoclimate were first suspected and the natural greenhouse effect first identified. In the late 19th century, scientists first argued that human emissions of greenhouse gases could change the climate. Many other theories of climate change were advanced, involving forces from volcanism to solar variation. In the 1960s, the warming effect of carbon dioxide gas became increasingly convincing, although some scientists also pointed out that human activities, in the form of atmospheric aerosols (e.g., ""pollution""), could have cooling effects as well. During the 1970s, scientific opinion increasingly favored the warming viewpoint. By the 1990s, as a result of improving fidelity of computer models and observational work confirming the Milankovitch theory of the ice ages, a consensus position formed: greenhouse gases were deeply involved in most climate changes, and human emissions were bringing serious global warming. Since the 1990s, scientific research on climate change has included multiple disciplines and has expanded, significantly increasing our understanding of causal relations, links with historic data and ability to numerically model climate change. The most recent work has been summarized in the Assessment Reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.",1410322742.0,1,0,,False,0,,,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2014,9,0.026617315

If someone calls cardiac arrest a heart attack because they don't know they're different things, they're speaking from ignorance. This is forgivable, as people won't all know all things, ya?

But if educated people who likely know better willfully engage in the same ""vernacular mistake"" of calling something by its incorrect name, because it advances a narrative and makes it easier to sell their position, well... that starts to feel like deception, which I am not tolerant of.

[Arab countries all discriminate against Palestinians](http://elderofziyon.blogspot.co.uk/p/all-arab-countries-except-jordan.html)

cpbsx9c,t3_2yog96,t3_2yog96,LawJusticeOrder,,"Well it definitely could be ""meddling"" but if the Iranians back off the deal because of this silly reason then the Republicans are proven correct for not trusting the Iranians (who clearly are looking for reasons to back out of the deal or to take offense so easily and act in a way that seems like they truly don't care about a deal but just want to get a weapon).

I think that the Republicans are playing with fire. But if the Iranians respond negatively, then the Republicans have proven their point that they are unreasonable jihadists.

The Republican strategy is to basically unravel the nuclear-deal because of the elephant in the room that Iran doesn't need a nuclear weapon or even nuclear energy (since they have lots of oil) and that the sanctions are really working and that's the only reason Iran came to the table to get them lifted but nothing that would significantly undermine their plans. The Republicans say ""no deal is better than a bad deal that helps them get funds/resources/enrichment/facilities."" 

The Democratic strategy is to have any deal that will seem like progress is being made and that Iranian's nuclear program is slowed somewhat. The slowing is the alternative that Obama wants because many Democrats believe that the only other alternative to blatant hiding of nuclear sites and continuing this course is war. So to avoid any wars the Democrats want to simply slow the process and deal with an Iranian nuclear-state, just as they deal with N. Korea. Many Democrats say ""any deal is good (and may slow them down), no matter how bad.""

Meanwhile the leader of Iran:

&gt;“Those who are experts on this matter know that producing 20 percent from 5 percent is much more significant than producing uranium which is higher than 20 percent,” he said. “However, our youth and our committed scientists did so.”

Remember that people were worried about 5 percent years ago. Now they're worried about the easy path from going from 20% to 90% (much easier than 5% TO 20%). Iran is blatantly violating international law, but there is no consequence except sanctions. They have been willing to take sanctions as a hit. If they are willing to take sanctions then the international laws are not working.

While the Congressional Research Service says:

&gt;“LEU used in nuclear power reactors typically contains less than 5% uranium-235,” said CRS, “research reactor fuel can be made using 20% uranium-235; HEU used in nuclear weapons typically contains about 90% uranium-235.”

&gt;“Iran’s production of LEU enriched to the 20% level has caused concern because such production requires approximately 90% of the effort necessary to produce weapons-grade HEU, which, as noted, contains approximately 90% uranium-235,” said CRS.

In other words: the problem is not that Iran has enriched Uranium to ONLY 20%. It's that they have done the HARDEST part of the job of making weapons-grade uranium. They've hidden facilities from international organizations. They've already built a lot of ICBM-style weapons that can only be used for nuclear war.

That is the true problem and Democrats &amp; Republicans differ in how to deal with it. Democrats want to slow it &amp; deal with a nuclear state. Republicans want to completely punish Iran &amp; never ever allow a nuclear state of Iran.

Millions of lives are under RISK under either the Republican or Democrat strategy. Both have significant risk of war.",1426105706.0,7,0,,1426106018,0,,,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2015,3,0.3389984

EMTALA already provides some governance on when/how a patient can be refused treatment, and guidelines on patient transfers.  RNs cannot walk out in the middle of their shift without transferring care of their patients, or else they risk losing their license for patient desertion.  There are all kinds of existing legal and ethical rules about practitioner -patient relationships, including no duty to treat if there is no physician-patient relationship (for example, someone cannot go to a doctor's or RN's house and knock on their door and say ""I know you're a doctor, you have to remove this wart right now because I say so!"")

As far as private practice, physicians get to refuse new patients all of the time.  Following certain guidelines and documenting reasons, they can fire patients they already have established relationships with.  And never are they dragged out of their homes and forced to provide care.

Giving every American a right to pursue exams and treatment by giving them the right to FUNDED healthcare has nothing to do with slavery of physicians, or the right to home invasions, and Rand Paul knows that.

She was an original cosponsor of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 and authored the 2006 and 2007 Standing With Minimum Wage Act to tie congressional salary increases to an increase in the minimum wage.

&gt;Hillary has said that ""inherited wealth and concentrated wealth is not good for America,"" and she consistently voted against repealing the estate tax on millionaires, doing so in 2001, 2002, and 2006.

&gt;Hillary Clinton has long advocated for a fairer tax system that works for all Americans, not just the most fortunate. In the Senate she consistently fought for middle-class tax cuts, including tax credits for student loan recipients, and keeping in place the tax cuts for those who make under $250,000 a year.

&gt;She worked to make millionaires pay their fair share by closing the ""carried interest"" tax loophole that allows Wall Street executives to pay a lesser percentage of their income than regular working Americans.

&gt;She has fought to crack down on CEO compensation, introducing legislation to let shareholders have a say in the companies they invest in.

Also the 2008 primaries: 

&gt;In keeping with her voting record, Clinton ran to Obama's left on economic issues in the 2008 primaries. This manifested itself most clearly on the subject of health care, where Clinton was willing to include a politically unpopular individual mandate to buy health insurance as part of a program for universal coverage. Obama was not willing to go so far, and came in for substantial criticism from liberals for it. Less famously, Clinton proposed a Cabinet-level poverty czar position — an idea that might make a comeback in 2016.

The 10th amendment (a virtually meaningless and trivial clause until the conservative pushback of the last generation) argument now becomes somewhat viable (IMO) because of Windsor. 

It is extremely unfortunate that great liberal causes are being written to law with, apparently, as little coherent logic as possible. No, it does not have to be that way; several prior justices --- Brennan, Black, Brandeis, even Marshall --- were able to achieve both. Even O'Connor --- not particularly liberal --- had a grand solution to the gay rights debacle in Lawrence. But, her opinion was limited to a concurrence in favor of Kennedy's rambling opinion. And the normally sharp Scalia could only offer this limp rebuttal to O'Connor's position: namely, that it would lead naturally to gay marriage, which was an 'absurdity' at the time.

&gt;List of countries by intentional homicide rate per year per 100,000 inhabitants. The reliability of underlying national murder rate data may vary.[1] The legal definition of ""intentional homicide"" differs among countries. Intentional homicide may or may not include infanticide, assisted suicide or euthanasia.[2]

Intentional homicide demographics are affected by changes in trauma care, leading to changed lethality of violent assaults, so the intentional homicide rate may not necessarily indicate the overall level of societal violence.[2] They may also be under-reported for political reasons.[3][4] Another problem for the comparability of the following figures is that some data may include attempts. In general the values in these lists should not include failed attempts except when mentioned otherwise.

Two countries I mentioned who share the closest cultural ties are the USA and Canada.  Before long it will be the USA and Mexico but that is something different.

The above link gives the murder rate: 

USA is at 4.7 per 100k.

Australia is 1.1 per 100k

&gt;Clinton's comments about her donor base weren't bullshit at all. First off, if Sanders can brag about how his donors are mostly from people giving ""30 bucks"", then it's fair for Clinton to highlight that 60% of her donors are women. The female vote is crucial in a general election, so it's a perfectly legitimate fact for her to highlight.

&gt;Now, onto the 9/11 comment. She was essentially being asked why big businesses and banks contribute so heavily to her campaign. She explained, correctly, that New York was attacked on 9/11. The markets closed after the terrorist attack, and the city needed their Senator to stand with them and help them rebuild so that business could get back to normal. Clinton was a very strong advocate for getting federal resources to New York after 9/11, and she did a good job on that, so it only follows that NYC-based businesses in general contributed to her campaigns, financial services companies included.

&gt;Bernie Sanders even said she was right and that he appreciates what she did for New York after 9/11.

No it isn't. Have you ever wondered what the circle-a symbol of anarchism stands for? A for Anarchy,and O for Order,meaning ""Anarchy is the mother of Order"".

&gt;You'd like it to be organized, but since people can't really be trusted to do the right thing and respect people's rights, authority is needed.

That is actually a non sequitur. We turn that around by saying that exactly because people cannot be trusted to do the right thing,no one should be allowed to rule. The object of power is power. You implicitly assume that rulers or those who hold authority are perfect and selfless,which is obvious nonsense. Hierarchy is for a fictional,perfect world.

""All parties without exception, when they seek for power, are varieties of absolutism."" - Pierre Joseph Proudhon

There would be no chaotic power vacuum you people imagine.
&gt;Yes there would, for the reasons stated above. You have to be ignorant of human nature and history to believe this.

Humans,as all other animals,do what is good for survival. In feudalism,it really wasn't good for survival to not obey royalty. In capitalism,it really isn't good for survival to not be greedy and competitive. And in socialism,it really won't be good for survival to not share and to not be altruistic. ""Human nature"" changes as external conditions change. 

Because there are no rulers,power is distributed equally.
&gt;Except for those with more resources who take power.

The logic applies only in capitalism,while the economic system of anarchy is socialism - as in stateless socialism meaning worker worker control and ownership of their workplaces along with decentralized economic planning and/or non-capitalist free market.

cyset8r,t1_cysclma,t3_401h51,Thangleby_Slapdiback,,"&gt;Hello, my name is /u/postal_blowfish[, a non-batshit Bernie Sanders supporter who will vote for the whoever gets the nomination because fucking always my second, third, fourth, or fifth favorite brand of beer is still better than a glass of piss.

I'm surprised you are a Sanders supporter. I assume you live in a battleground state - one of those that could conceivably go either way. 

There are some rock-solid facts about the American body politic, postal_blowfish. Immutable facts. NYS will vote for the Democrat. So will VT, MA, MD, IL, MN, CA, OR &amp; WA. TX, LA, MS, AL, KS, OK,  are all going to go red, no matter what kind of voodoo we do. Neither candidate who realistically has a shot at the nomination is going to change that. There's no amount of wishful thinking that will make that happen.

I live in TX. I, too, am a Sanders supporter. While not batshit crazy - I am mad as as hell. I'm sick to death of the religious nutters. I'm angry as can be at the corporatists. I have long loathed the union of the two in the GOP - and really hated the DLC Democrats of the 90s, led by Bill Clinton. His wife, Hillary, was among them. The Clintons are the embodiment of corporatism in the Democratic Party. 

Now then, since I am a Sanders supporter, I'm sure you won't be at all surprised the I'm voting for Bernie in the primary and again in the general election should he be nominated. 

If he isn't nominated, I won't be voting for Hillary in the general election. I will go this route for two reasons. First, this isn't a battleground state, so me not voting for her will not make any difference whatsoever in the general election. Remember, whoever the GOP nominates will win the popular vote in Texas and hence all of the electoral votes. They're not awarded proportionally. It's a winner take all vote.

Voting for the ""Liberal"" candidate for President in the general election in Texas is about effective as writing in Vermin Supreme. 

So, what's an old labor-liberal to do? In this instance, while Clinton is on the side of the angels on social issues (as long as that's the direction the wind is blowing), her history is filled w/ Wall St. She brought her husband in to campaign for her. That makes his policies - his legacy - fair game. 

I'm  not going to get involved in any kind of silliness like the GOP of the era peddled. I don't care about any of the manufactured scandal of the era, and I certainly don't care what/who he might have put his penis into at any point in his life. I'm going to look strictly at his economic record - which on the surface is pretty danged good, right?

NAFTA. GATT. WTO, The Telecommunications Act of 1996. The Welfare act from '94. DMCA. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (repealing Glass-Steagall). Clinton's claim to political fame is that he managed to separate some of the Wall Street types from the GOP. Traditionally, to that point, they had donated to the GOP. By being ""liberal"" (for the times) on social issues, and mouthing the right platitudes to settle the masses who were fixing to lose their asses to outsourcing, he looked non-threatening to the more liberal types of Wall St. There again - all things are relative, right? He did do don't ask don't tell. A  - sort of - step forward, but not really. He also signed the Defense of Marriage Act.

And, lest I forget, when warned of derivatives trading potential to crash the entire banking system by his chair of the CFTC (Brooksley Born), he responded by running her off. This was in '96 - 12 years before the collapse of 2008.

Some legacy, huh?

Meanwhile, after leaving office, his wife became a Senator. Her donor list reads like a Who's Who of the very bankers who crashed the economy in '08. Well - that and people who work in telecommunications. Hardly surprising. Her husband's reign was very good to them and she was the Senator from NY, after all. Wall St. **was** her constituency.

On top of that, during her time as the Secretary of State she used her own e-mail server, maintained by God knows who, and secret information was moved through that server. She's under investigation by the FBI and there is a potential indictment in her future. Can't say it's going to happen, but it's entirely possible. 

Now then, why should I vote for her in the general election if she is the nominee? Remember, it'll do no good to anyway. Why should I vote for someone that I view as part of the political system that is and long has been fucking the working class of this country - especially since I'm a member of the working class?

I have long ridiculed working class republicans who voted republican because their candidates were so obviously deeply up the asses of any corporate hack who had a pile of cash. I see them as voting against their own best interest. 

Why would I vote against my own economic best interest. 

I will either write in Bernie in November, or I will vote for the Green party - as I did in '00.

Do you see it now?

I mean you said if the minimum wage is increased then middle and higher wages will go up as well. So then if all-- emphases on ""all""-- wages increase then the next domino to fall would be employers increasing the cost of product to minimize the economic loss- thereby technically rendering the minimum wage increase as pointless. 

Wouldn't employers simply raise the price to match the difference they'd be losing on an increased wage? For example, if the minimum wage now is $9.00 an hour and the price of a movie ticket is $9.25, well wouldn't pushing the wage up to $10.00 push the price of a movie ticket to $10.25? The answer here is yes, in practice it does. I know this because I live in Cali, I have worked at a movie theater for two years, and this has happened both times the minimum wage went up. Most people in my middle class/lower income community over the age of twenty frequently complain and ask why our ticket and concession prices are going up. They're angry about it because unlike the minimum wage earner (myself) their salaries do not go up and so now they are paying more. Do you understand what increasing the minimum wage does to the middle class? And this is just me giving you a personal example of a minimum wage increase in practice, but frankly this is economic common sense. As any movie theater cashier can attest, we hear the statement ""back in my day a ticket used to be a dollar"" at least a couple times a month, well that's because minimum wage was much lower as well. The price of an admission ticket today is based on the minimum wage of today. It's like a mirror in a way. Product prices mirror the minimum wage 

Second, Wait. A minimum wage worker who works 40 hours a week IS being paid a minimum wage for working 40 hours a week.  No one is saying a Burger King employee who works 40 hours is not entitled to 40 hours of pay, but simply that a Burger King employee deserves a lesser wage then, say, an EMT. That's a distinction I want to make clear. 

And as a side note I disagree with your assertion that Burger King employees are giving up their life. That's a technical semantic that I'm assuming you purposely made. As a correction, they aren't giving up their lives to man a register. Giving up your life is... say, joining the marines and accepting an agreement wherein you really do technically give up your life by accepting a binding contract of 8 years of service-- quitting will land you in prison and/or stain your job applicant record. Even as an Airman I signed a contract agreeing that I understand I will be assigned to a region that will threaten the safety of my physical and mental well being. It seems you're trying to equate that sacrifice to that of a cashier at Burger King and in all fairness I'm not buying it. 

And again, isn't economic equality about fairness? Pro higher wage advocates like to use ""the 1%"", or ""the 99%"". Okay, well service members constitute only 1% of the American population. I don't think it's fair that 1% of Americans who sacrifice their life for 100% of America now only earn $3.00 more than a Californian who works at Burger King. Wouldn't you agree? 

Third, That doesn't make sense. To be clear, I'm associating the price of a product as a reflection of wages. Wages go up, product price goes up.  If we are to have a middle class then there will always be a lower class that is-- by association-- making less than the middle class. So I don't see why it is an issue to be concerned about minimum wage workers earning less than their middle class career worker counterpart. 

And in regard to your last statement, should I take this to mean that you don't believe an EMT or a Marine deserve to make more than a Burger King cashier? To me that seems like a little bit of selfish entitlement and it doesn't seem fair at all. Again, a minimum wage is supposed to be a survivable wage: and as a reminder survivable isn't whether or not you can afford the nice amenities like an IPhone, survivable is a place to stay and food to eat and like I said-- I live in a tiny house with my wife and I work a minimum wage job and we do get by. I'm just trying to understand the pro-higher wage argument but so far I'm not convinced that this is a viable solution to our economic woes.",1459875804.0,0,0,,1459875994,0,,False,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2016,4,0.0969861

I'm no fan of Huff Post, [but I stumbled across this very well-researched article fact-checking Stein](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jill-stein-may-not-be-anti-vax-but-shes-pushing-a-dangerous-anti-vax-theory_us_579f885ce4b0693164c1fab4). 

Basically, Stein is peddling a cynical and fringe theory used by anti-vaxxers that has no basis in fact:

&gt; **Medical experts respond with disdain and disappointment**
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Paul Offit, a professor of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, slammed Stein for peddling conspiracy theories in what he thinks might be an effort to appeal to alternative health voters.
&gt; 
&gt; “She’s not skeptical, she’s cynical,” Offit said to HuffPost. “Where is the evidence that corporate influence has caused either the [Food and Drug Administration] or [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] to make decisions to hurt American children?”
&gt; 
&gt; . . . . 
&gt; 
&gt; **America’s vaccine regulation process is world class**
&gt; 
&gt; Patsy Stinchfield, senior director of infection prevention and control at Children’s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, called the vaccine regulation process a “model government public/private decision-making body” because of the transparency and openness of the meetings, the inclusion of journalists in the room, and rules that require ACIP members to disclose any financial holdings in vaccine companies and abstain from voting if they have a conflict of interest.
&gt; 
&gt; “The chance is nil for corporate influence on the CDC vaccine deliberations,” said Stinchfield, who has been involved with ACIP for 14 years ― four as a voting member and 10 as a liaison representing the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners.
&gt; 
&gt; Heidi Larson, director of The Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said pharmaceutical corporations can only dream of influencing the process in the way Stein suggests.
&gt; 
&gt; “Drug companies may wish they dictated the regulation of vaccines (and other products), but they don’t,” she said. “The regulatory bodies need to have regular contact with corporations because they regulate them ― it does not mean that they are controlled by the corporations.”

Whoa. Herd immunity doesn't require 100% vaccination rates. Not even close, for all but the most virulent diseases. Any single individual not getting immunized doesn't put anyone else at risk. For many diseases, you could have 1 in 5 people not get immunized and we'd still have herd immunity; there aren't enough people susceptible to the disease, and the disease has a low enough transmission rate/likelihood, that outbreaks just aren't going to happen.

I looked at the numbers earlier today, and there are only two diseases where the 9% of people who think vaccines are worse than the risk of the disease could pose a problem, and that's measles and whooping cough (and measles is very low mortality, and functionally eliminated from the US). Both of those diseases require 92-95% immunization rate for ""herd immunity"".

I think you're overstating your case. Whooping cough might be the only disease where public education *might* be insufficient to guarantee herd immunity.",1470166620.0,-2,0,,False,0,,False,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2016,8,0.112746716

The fear part is too general, I think.  Haidt suggests in *Righteous Mind* that conservatives have a more accurate and real-time awareness of personal safety, while liberals have the empathy you mentioned.  It's a semantic difference but I wanted to close the vagueness door.

These days, I think conservatives see wide-left liberals as a danger because of their overzealous empathy..  example..  in some cases according to Haidt, liberals have done more damage to the group they are trying to help (unintended long term consequences due to rapid response with little foresight] like the continual welfare we see in some parts of the country which doesn't motivate people to search for work. Liberals are less likely to support the country and benefit the nation by questioning authority and challenging the status quo.

Conservatives are not innocent!  
Stubborn and curiously indignant by nature, conservatives appreciate the status quo and are slow to accept change. This must be infuriating to liberals because 'we need this NOW!', and conservatives would rather take their time to fully understand the situation. We find it easy to be loyal to the country out of principle and for the benefit if the country through solidarity.  I am biased, please add to my description...  

We are finding ourselves outnumbered these days, but not necessarily in numbers.  Liberal representatives, educators, the rich, and business owners are leaning more liberal.  Political correctness is a bane of our existence, and I would rather have a beer and talk about the inner workings of a aircraft than politics..  just leave it alone!  
We are becoming defensive because we can't possibly understand why there are so many things about the country that are all of the sudden an atrocity- we feel insulted because we are proud to be Americans.

Imho, the kids are giving liberals a bad name.  People who don't have any life experience but a college education just effective enough to make them actively gullible don't have any credibility. And then you want us to pay you more to flip a burger when many other careers of decidedly higher importance are left with low salaries?  Sheesh.

Anyways if you made it this far, thanks for listening.  I know I am biased so I welcome the conversation, it's an opportunity to learn about the different schools of though across the aisle.  No worries.

2) I don't think it's futile per se to be proud of one's race. Misguided and foolish, yes, but not entirely futile. I've heard a commonly cited argument that minorities are proud racially because they lack other binding cultural factors to be proud of (this is something I've found is most commonly cited for the reason behind the existence of ""black culture"" and ""black America"" less than, for example, a hypothetical ""Asian America"" or ""biracial America""). And in that respect, I suppose it does serve some emotional and cultural purpose in lieu of a more targeted and established ethnic identity. But on a personal level, I feel that racial identity and racial pride are separate things. There's no sense in being ""proud"" of your skin color. You didn't accomplish being black or white. You didn't build your skin. You didn't earn your skin. It's just there. It makes as much sense as being proud of any other cultural factor, like your gender or nationality -- that is, none at all.

3) In some respects, yes, in others, no. Race does matter to certain extents. Different racial groups and identities are often correlated with certain experiences. Broadly speaking, the experience of a black person growing up will often not be the same of a comparable white person's upbringing, and so on and so forth. So in the respect of trying to pretend they all have the same cultural/social/economic experience, no, you can't just say ""I don't see race."" But in terms of who you hire or who you're friends with or who you date or who you associate with, yes, absolutely, that's okay.

4) Race doesn't confer any characteristics to anyone beyond skin color and other associated physical features, none of which are objectively superior in any way to others. That said, subjectively, it's totally fine if, say, you find people of one race more physically attractive than another. But that's basically the only example I can think of where one race might be ""superior,"" and even then, that's *entirely* subjective and dependent on who you ask.",1481608497.0,3,0,,False,0,,False,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2016,12,0.36095104

dcy00rz,t3_5qaiu9,t3_5qaiu9,eggscores,,"&gt; Right now, the only people with the capacity to stop Trump are Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, and their Republican colleagues in Congress. At the minimum, they could refuse to go along with some of his more illiberal proposals; at the maximum, they could theoretically invoke the Twenty-fifth Amendment and deem him unfit for office. The overwhelming likelihood is that they will do neither of these things.

&gt; On Tuesday, Ryan did say that he had “seen no evidence” of widespread voter fraud, but he refused to be drawn out any further. McConnell bowed and scraped to Trump, saying that voter fraud “does happen.” Other Republicans made similar weaselly statements. And, of course, some of the shock jocks and right-wing outriders who cheered Trump to victory supported his incendiary assertions.

&gt; Because G.O.P. legislators in many parts of the country have used similarly dubious allegations to justify voter-suppression efforts, this response shouldn’t have been surprising. As Trump has done many times before, he took a bogus issue that Republicans have pursued for years and exploited it for his own purposes. Some Party elders and commentators might have concerns, but that’s not because he’s undermining a basic institution of democracy—it’s largely because they fear that he will alienate moderate voters. And if Trump’s proposed investigation does serve as a pretext for legislation designed to make it harder for minorities, immigrants, and poor people to vote, that will be just fine by the G.O.P.",1485457598.0,1,0,,False,0,,False,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2017,1,0.17111848

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3nF9XwGA34

Read how to win friends and influence people.

Know more about what ""liberals"" believe than they do. You can start with the fact that the PC/social justice crowd of the left aren't liberals in the first place.  

Read (or read about) classical liberal enlightenment philosophers like john locke or john stuart mill.

John stuart mill's book ""On Liberty"" is pretty much the gospel of free speech.

Read about John Rawl's theory of justice.

None, The outlets complaining about fake news are the one's publishing it. It's just there different degrees of fakeness. 

Most have some kind of bias. They lie by omission, take events and quotes out of context or misrepresent them.

It's the double edge sword of our modern world. It's great there's no one controlling information. It's also terrible because now you have to read 20 levels of sources to verify any article you read.

Yes, he did (assuming that is where he went). It doesn't matter if he joined for other reasons and went to those places he still had the choice to not be involved. It may have been an uninformed choice or a highly pressured choice but he still had the power to choose not to go even once being assigned and ordered to do it. 

Even so, I'm not outright judging him for his decision to go in the first place. The military is good at fooling kids into thinking war is something that it isn't. If he were to look back on his time like many others and realize that what he did is not something to take pride in then that is fine.

The treatment of illegal immigrants harms all workers and the middle class as well.


What this liberal is opposed to is treating illegal immigrants in an inhuman way.

This liberal is also outraged that there are no employer sanctions used to stop the illegal immigrants.

You can show me liberals protesting mass deportation but you can't show me mass liberal promotion of not using deportation.

That isn't contradictory.

There will be no stopping illegal immigration without meaningful penalties against the employers.

The activists were invited to present their arguments, and supporting evidence, for debate. The quote I posted is specifically addressing what they see as a failing of the rule, that they question the validity of psychiatric interviews as a definitive means of evaluation which Goldwater specifically relies upon as the de facto means.

But, yes, they are flying in the face of a rule which dates from 1973 because, from their collective, varied, career long experience, they feel they have observed enough of Trump to make a valid evaluation, to the extent that they have, and subsequently made these comments.

&gt;It is unethical and incompetent to attempt to diagnose someone without a genuine evaluation

They're breaking that one APA Code Of Ethics regulation, for sure, but that's kind of the point of the statement. A lot has changed with our understanding of evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment since '73 so they're challenging that rule because in the current climate, and with it's fresh abridgments to the rule, they feel that Goldwater is being leveraged specifically to stifle the voices of professionals who are concerned and feel it's in the publics interest, and the ethical path to take, to speak out in such instances. And to stifle debate about that topic itself. The extension of this is that they feel that Goldwater needs to be revised because it itself is unethical.

So, unless you yourself are an expert in medical ethics and law, or are an expert in the field of psychiatry, I don't think you really have much more than a personal opinion here and that, sadly, doesn't really count for much.

dgf02sz,t3_6609y7,t3_6609y7,edgarde,,"I have to wonder how Obama got elected twice in a country so racist they didn't vote for Hillary Clinton. Racism was always a factor, but I imagine it may have worked to Obama's advantage with ""high-risk"" voters &amp;mdash; those who didn't see a clear path to improving their lot, but are dissatisfied with conventional approaches. 

* [voters like this one](http://www.kchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2008-10-21_stories_from_the.gif 'potentially offensive cartoon based on a real event') (^[source](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/on-road-western-pennsylvania/) )

When I say *advantage*, I'm imagining the perception that a black candidate is automatically ""Left"", or at least somehow radically different than the norm, when in reality O was a moderate indistiguishable from Clinton or Biden. John Edwards [ran left of Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edwards#Policy_positions), and got shot down so fast his infidelity scandal was like a superfluous post-script. But Edwards would have been closest to what these voters were seeking. 

When Obama failed to produce significant change, voters skipped Obama v.2 in favor of the candidate who talks like their alcoholic uncle, since he seemed most likely to stir things up. 

Perhaps any Democrat would have been considered Obama v.2, but Hillary Clinton was a ""sure thing"" candidate. It was assumed her machine made her the only candidate that could stand up to the post-*Citizens United* Republican Party. Sanders would have been the risky candidate, unproven in heavy attack campaigns and bound to alienate the big money. 

In other news, I hear turnout from black voters was relatively low because these voters increasingly perceive their issues were [ignored by Democrats](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/black-voters-are-so-loyal-that-their-issues-get-ignored/).

Business is business, companies that choose to be environmentally minded will have reduced operating costs and be able to pass that along to consumers or employees either way they will be in a better place to do business than companies that decide to dig in and not change anything. I find it funny people opposed to the tax feel that the price increase of goods is a jab at it because that is the purpose, make it inconvenient for a business to operate if they choose to dump pollutants into the environment without any concern. If a business wants to be competitive they will need to adjust how they operate.  We will start to see better greener businesses start to pop up and thrive while heavy polluters that we don’t want will struggle. This focus on the environment is being adopted more and more across the world.  It’s already started, many are choosing not to do as much business with companies that have terrible human rights and environmental practices.

The stage was set earlier, but the party began its slide in 72' when McGovern was beat by Nixion, and not by a slim margin either.  If the left couldn't deliver victory even amidst a deeply unpopular war, what use were they politically?  The 70's remained turbulent for many reasons.  Then the 80's happened, where not only did Union membership decline become pronounced, but Regan crushed the Liberal Mondale in 84'.

Following the 84' loss, the Democratic Leadership Council was formed with the goal of running moderate, business friendly Democrats, raising funds from business, and thereby reducing the party's reliance on Labor funding (to say nothing of responsiveness to Labor).  The recipe didn't work in 88', but it did work for Bill Clintion, who then staffed the party leadership and set the party's course for years to follow.  However, the plan may have played out; given the choice between a pro-business and extremely pro-business party, the electorate that would see the government as a check on the rapaciousness of capitalism haven't been satisfied for some time.  Minorities that were supposed to bridge the gap left by Labor need the same protections that Labor has been pushing for this whole time.  Discontent is growing to the point that an avowed (Democratic) *Socialists* nearly won the party nomination, using a strategy alien to the the party leadership.

Now the party has a hard decision in front of it.

Stay tied to the center, continue to reap good funding from the business community, but wrestle with a pronounced enthusiasm gap.

Turn left, embrace a younger and energetic constituency that wants a more liberal US government, but contend with a reduced budget to campaign with.

dlbbqev,t1_dlb8ca0,t3_6s11vp,thegoonfather,,"&gt;You are insane, it only was considered booming thanks to new tech released before Clinton took office.

You're an idiot, there are several reasons for the Clinton boom, the internet first and foremost among them, but the economic boom is something that NAFTA would have done something to counter were it actually the problem you so mistakenly believe it is. 

&gt;Jobs weren't lost to automation they were lost to jobs going to Mexico, they still employ almost as many people they just pay them next to nothing and don't have to follow safety regulations. The 700k figure is what was actually lost, it's not some figure that's an estimate, it actually happened along with double that getting pushed into lower paying jobs.

Jobs are lost all of the time to automation, factories are run with a fraction of the employees they were. You can see machines replacing cashiers in plenty of retail stores. No, the 700K figure is not net jobs actually lost (you don't know the difference between net and total do you?), it's a made up number based on a flawed methodology, there's no documentation of that actually happening. 

As far as twice that number being pushed to lower paying jobs, you don't have a single shred of evidence to support that. You're making things up.

&gt;I agree they don't deserve their ire, who does deserve it are the politicians who passed this bullshit and let it happen.

Not for NAFTA, since as I showed you, it had a positive effect on the economy. People that deserve ire are morons whose ignorance stands in the way of actual solutions. 

&gt;You're really gonna use a study sponsored by the government to try and prove your point?

That study wasn't funded by the gov't, and it was conducted by credible economists and published and reviewed for an economic journal. It's funding would be irrelevant even if what you said was true, as the gov't often funds research that both supports and contradicts the effectiveness of its policy, and there are plenty of moronic anti-NAFTA gov't politicians and bureaucrats. 

I can't believe you cited a Rolling Stone article, after that bullshit UVA rape case that they did no fact checking on.

&gt;You keep race baiting and it has nothing to do with race or immigrants, it has to do with politicians who didnt give a shit about how they were fucking people over.

I didn't say anything about race. I'm not surprised you don't know the difference between xenophobia and race. As far as anti-NAFTA sentiment being overblown and seated in xenophobia, that's completely true since facts don't support the position. I realize the notion that your view in based on a subconscious disgust for people from somewhere else, but don't project the feeling of being slandered onto others as some kind of pathetic defense mechanism. 

You don't know the first thing about NAFTA. It was first and foremost tariff reduction legislation. There was nothing about it that made companies leave in droves to avoid the cost of OSHA compliance. That you conflate the two shows how little you know about this. It's funny you think NAFTA killed jobs by allowing employers to hire cheap foreign labor, while also blaming unions who work to compel companies to hire Americans at a collectively bargained for wage. You're positions lie in direct contradiction to each other because you're obsessed with blaming every factor other than the ones that deserve it.

If I mow my neighbor's lawn for 20$, I consider myself the rightful owner of that money, even if some other guy did a harder job for less somewhere else.

If we accept that people do not have a legitimate claim to their income, it does not follow that taxation is morally permissible. It would no longer be theft, but it would remain an act of coercion, needing justification. The state cannot be plausibly thought to have a stronger claim to the product of a citizen's labor than the citizen himself. Therefore, one would be permitted to simply withhold that money from being taxed; but the state violently punishes anyone refusing to comply with its demands. One possible explanation is that since tax funds are redistributed to the less fortunate, it is permissible to employ coercion towards that noble goal. But this fails to account for the fact that the state has a monopoly on wealth redistribution: I cannot mug people to fund my favorite charity. If what the government does is deemed acceptable, on what grounds can a benevolent thief be punished for his actions?

The second argument seems equally implausible. While the state does provide services facilitating the creation of wealth, jumping to the conclusion that taxation is thus justified seems premature.

We can imagine a private individual acting in this manner. Suppose my neighbor, completely unsolicited, were to shovel my driveway. He would then demand payment, and if necessary, would employ violence to obtain that money. This is obviously unacceptable. The fact that he has provided me with a valuable service does not entitle him to a reward, nor does it justify his violent behavior. 

The article states that since public services are essential to the earning of an income, it follows that a portion of that income must be paid back towards that common fund which enables the continuous production of wealth by citizens. This, again, seems incorrect. 

In the previous example, my neighbor could have argued that it was his labor which allowed me to leave for work in the morning, and that it was only fair that I pay him back with a portion of what he helped me earn. But by employing coercion to take my money, he is still taking my property without my consent. I could have shovelled the driveway myself. I may have hired someone else to do it. Maybe I would have stayed at home, hoping the snow would go away. It doesn't matter: when my neighbor takes my money, he is stealing from me.

Furthermore, the sevices provided by the state are always funded through taxation. The argument then becomes nonsensical, as it attempts to justify the present act of coercion with another, previous coercive act. This is equivalent to my neighbor extorting me for money, then shovelling my driveway, and then demanding payment so he can continue shovelling snow.

Of course I think this is a great thing. Psychologically, one of the main things that causes prejudice is simple [lack of exposure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect). Not to mention that this allows people to travel more, to do more cool things and meet more cool new people, and makes countries richer through more trade, brings everyone together in peace...

So what are the options? What does it even mean to be ""for"" or ""against"" multiculturalism? Multiculturalism is the natural outcome of economic growth and information age technology. The only way to be against it is to be against the free market, the free movement of people, the free expression of ideas, the freedom of each individual to live their life the way they want to live it, etc...

I think a lot of the talk right now about ""multiculturalism"" is kind of a dog whistle. If you're ""against multiculturalism"" what you're really saying, logically, is that you're against individual freedom. If you actually think through the logical implications, that's the only thing it can possibly mean. But naturally, no wants wants to say explicitly they are ""against freedom"" so they talk about ""muh culture"".

So no, I don't think all countries ""should be multicultural"" because that's a loaded question implying that it is somehow forced or the result of strident policy rather than a natural economic outcome. But I am definitely against authoritarianism, so to answer your question another way, for that reason yes, I think all countries should accept migrants, all governments should treat everyone with equality before the law, should be secular, should not discriminate arbitrarily - every government in every country should have *due process* for every person, native or not, that goes through their legal system, simply because that is right and fair.",1508296019.0,1,0,,False,0,False,False,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2017,10,0.059974585

You can have multicultural authoritarians such as in the Mongol Empire and the various Islamic Caliphates and you can have a free, individualistic society with largely mono-cultures such as in Japan, Israel and some European nations. I like US style multiculturalism with a melting pot, but I can also recognize that issues involving policing and violence are greatly exacerbated by having cultures with fundamentally different values in an area. There are enough cases where multiculturalism has contributed to bad ends that I can't reflexively support it for all situations.

Multiculturalism in Rwanda, Yugoslavia, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, Iraq, Palestine Mandate and other unstable states ended up greatly contributing to the state breaking down into ethnic groups which were much stronger than national identity. In many cases genocide and ethnic violence broke out which in some cases only stopped when physical barriers were erected to keep hated communities separated.

There are also situations where letting people live and mingle freely into their borders led to new groups taking power and deciding to enact new rules for their own benefit. A few off the top of my head are most native or indigenous tribes in the Americas and Australia (though others around the world certainly qualify), Palestinians displaced by Zionist migration, and the [barbarian migrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_Period) in Europe. You can argue that these aren't ""true multiculturalism"", but there are significant negative consequences for letting in large groups of people that want to fundamentally change the country and don't care for our laws or culture.

For these reasons I am more willing to listen when ethnic minorities talk about keeping their communities and cultures in tact, and have seen situations where that seems like an appropriate solution (indigenous communities and ethnic minorities, gentrification). I am also extremely hesitant to let in groups that clearly want to replace native populations or force them to accept their laws and religion.",1508299557.0,1,0,,False,0,False,False,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2017,10,0.19986437

Left liberalism, right liberalism, or just liberalism in general? Liberal ethics, lifestyles, and/or political views?

&gt;Contrary to what most 20 year olds think, cognition maximizes around age 45-50 due to the sheer amount of gathered information and experience having more influence that instincts and emotion. This has nothing to do with reaction time, etc. So when an older person says something you think is wrong, especially if it is complex (opposed to a simple trivia fact) you should think twice before writing them off as an uninformed old idiot.

I'd say cognition *can* maximize around age 50. If you spend 30 years out of school doing nothing but watching Netflix, drinking beer, and avoiding any difficult work, I don't think you'd be smarter at 50. Then again, if you keep working and thinking, you can keep climbing the ladder, and maybe age 50 is the inversion point where age just starts to become more of a negative than a positive.

Fox News—and the “conservative” MSM at large—is for people who think religious fundamentalism, blind faith, and xenophobia are an acceptable foundation on which to construct a worldview. Similarly, the “liberal” MSM is for people who arrogantly believe that they’re inherently immune to ignorance, confirmation bias, naïveté, shortsightedness, and deception, just because they’re educated enough to understand that the separation of church and state = for the best. 

When it comes down to it, the only significant difference between American liberals and American conservatives is which of their buttons corporate propagandists have to push in order to manipulate them into acting against their own best interests.

At any rate, I’m 0% surprised you jumped to the conclusion you just did. Folks like you have become depressingly predictable lately. If I had a dollar for every time some self-righteous faux-liberal baselessly accused me of being a delusional, right-wing moron, I could afford to start my own national, for-profit, corporate news conglomerate, and proceed to shamelessly manipulate public opinion with distracting sensationalism, half-truths, lies-by-omission, and narrow-scoped pseudo-narratives, just like the folks at Fox News, CNN, and every other billionaire-sponsored news conglomerate most Americans blindly depend on to stay “informed” when they can’t be bothered to think for themselves.

Hate to break it to you man, but if you’re *legitimately* under the impression that only an idiot would mistrust the MSM, then you’re the one who’s living in a bubble of delusion, absolutely guaranteed. Truth is, I would *gladly* stake my life on that fact. More importantly, I *intend* to. Can you honestly say to yourself that you’d eagerly stake your life on the trustworthiness of for-profit institutions controlled *exclusively* by aloof and out-of-touch billionaires? It legitimately doesn’t take a genius—or even an intellectual—to figure out that the American “free press”—just like our federal government—has long since been corrupted by too-big-to-fail crony capitalism. Alas, here you are blindly defending the trustworthiness of corrupt institutions without even pausing to *think* about whether or not you’re doing the right thing.

Hope you escape your bubble before you and your family end up paying for the sins of people who think you’re nothing more than debt slaves, while those same people sit back and laugh at sheer magnitude of your self-defeating idiocy.

So, thank you for being honest with my answer and I shall continue to do the same...

I can understand that you're not religious. You're right, you've made it quite well known that religion isn't your cup of tea. Therefore, I have to wonder, do you understand the cake shop owner's dilemma? On one hand, he doesn't want to be a dick to his patrons, the people who keep him in business, and on the other he has deeply held religious views on the celebration of homosexual unions. 

As the adage goes, ""God, Country, Family."" For him and many other religious people, God comes before all else. That is why we have the 1st amendment, so that the government can't tell you how to practice, and he can't force you to practice a certain way through the government. It wasn't the act of selling cakes to homosexuals he objected to, it was partaking in the celebration of something he believed to be sinful. Those are his views, and thankfully not the governments. It would be tyrannical for the government to cause you to do something against your own religious conscience. In the same breath, it is unlawful to discriminate against someone for something that isn't their own fault (age, race, sex, etc).

Yes, there are limitations on that- and those limitations are very much stemmed from impeding on other people's Natural Rights. The right to patronage is not a Natural Right. We also have the Freedom of Association. The government cannot tell us who we can and cannot associate with. Therefore, although he may discriminate what services he provides under any given circumstance, he cannot (and wouldn't) outright deny people just because of their skin or lawful lifestyle.

So while we are talking in terms of Christianity, we have to expand the the argument to the most extremes: What if your religion was to kill people every Wednesday? Well, that would impede on other individual's Natural Rights. That's a no-go. What if your religion was to pray 5 times a day? OK, knock yourself out. What if your religion was to pray 5 times a day, stopping what you were doing, causing you to impede highway traffic. Again, that's a no-go.

That's not even talking about the vast amounts of the federal budget earmarked for discretionary spending, most of which ends up getting thrown at the military.

2. Should be noted that the research appealed to in the article relied on data from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.

3. That research also included the effects of the legal citizens descendant from illegal immigrants, which would describe members of Trump's own family.

4. They didn't take into consideration anything that might have been added to the economy (for example, working for decades and having payroll taxes taken out, the benefits of which an illegal immigrant often can't normally realize), but merely how much it cost in tax dollars. Of course poor people cost more than wealthy people in terms of welfare, that's the whole point. But that doesn't mean that your contribution to the economy is a net negative just because you have a child going to public school and you have access to emergency services like the fire department, and frankly, it doesn't even mean that your contribution in tax dollars (e.g. payroll taxes) doesn't outweigh such benefits.

5. I haven't completely gone through their methodology yet, but your Yale study seems to be the only one yielding such results.

But that just *your* end game. May come as a surprise that others want *all* guns banned. It’s an extremely slippery slope. Most people calling for an AR ban don’t even know what an AR is, stands for, or how to define it. By your stance, I assume you’re one of them. There are dozens of other “hunting rifles” out there that do the same thing but aren’t black or scary looking. 

Mass shooting* by type since 1982. Total 107
Handguns - 87
Rifles - 42 of these, 13 AR’s
Shotguns - 26

https://www.statista.com/statistics/811487/number-of-mass-shootings-in-the-us/

There’s an estimated 8 million AR platforms owned in the US. By far the most popular style yet, the fact is, they’re LEAST used. I’ll concede that it’ll go up based on sheer numbers available, but by that logic we have to get rid of all Labrador Retrievers because they top the list at nearly 600,000 dog bites annually. 

And why isn’t an AR a hunting rifle? Ask the people from New Mexico to North Carolina, whose livelihoods are getting destroyed by wild pigs. Although good ol fashion explosives are getting popular. Or the guys from Pennsylvania to Montana using them in an attempt to slow down the insane coyote populations. The AR platform is the most versatile and particularly ideal for night hunting. 

I’m not lacking reason or common sense. Others are lacking understanding by judging something(s) they don’t even understand. I can buy a black plastic kit and slap it on my first gun (most popular kids gun in the country) and people would shit themselves. 

 The gun referenced above (got mine when I was 6) is semi-auto with detachable mag, but none of the additional traits. 

Now let’s point out the details that have no bearing on the effectiveness of the weapon in a school shooting. Bayonet and grenade launcher. You ever see kids running around with a fucking grenade launcher?

1994 law describes assault rifle as:
1. Semiautomatic rifles having the ability to accept a detachable ammunition magazine and at least two of the following traits:
● A folding or telescoping stock.

Similarly, his nickname might turn people off of him. His MO is anti-nationalism. Well, there is nothing conservatives care about more than making the country ever more nationalistic, jingoistic, xenophobic, etc. He confronts them directly on the issues they care about most. So I'm not sure how he would do in the general election. He only leads Trump by a few points in swing states in polls. The worst elements of American society would truly despise him and turn out to vote against him.

The media hates him, and has already been running a lot of negative pieces on him, many dishonest. These will probably have an effect.

Pros: He confronts nationalism directly, squarely. He isn't afraid to reassert the liberal values this country was founded on.

He has a voting record that is neither moderate nor very progressive. According to govtrack, he is right in the ideological center of the Democratic Party, meaning he could appeal to the whole entire party, and unite all the left against Republicans.

He has been on the right side of certain important issues for his whole career, namely criminal justice/drug law reform, immigration, conservation, veterans issues, anti-war, and civil liberties. Particularly drug and immigration reform. He knows those issues very well. He was one of the earliest voices calling for ending the war on drugs.

He grew up on the border, and spent his whole political career representing the nation's largest border community. So again, he has the qualifications to rebuke Trump on his own signature issue.

He has a good amount of experience, but not too much. Before politics, he was in a hacktivist group and a punk rock band, and started a small business. Those could either hurt him or help him, we will have to wait and see.

I have no worries about people coming into the country as long as they follow the legal process and are deemed safe.

Yet, a racist person will also want a stricter border since they're Mexicans. Does my belief in trumps border policy mean I agree with the racists? (although you can make the argument that he doesn't do much about visas). Thats where specification has to be necessary.

most people in these political subreddits) however I read the article at the end on how the 30s something page Mueller indictment of Russian meddling shows that it's undeniable. 


I want to ask something like what benefit does Russia have in influencing the elections but I'm not going to push it. However I'm thinking that because Russia was exposed to trying to make Hillary Clinton look bad, then Republicans took it as an alliance, or at least as an advantage. Thus 2016 was a win by Trump. 

My guess is that since it wasn't enough evidence to convict Trump, at least the government's New goal is  to increase security in the electronic voting booths. 

Let's say that the democrats in Congress become more numerous in the next few years. They could fix not only the vulnerabilities in the voting booth from 2016 but also the whole electoral college system.

Our state government is, hands down, no competition, the best state government in the US. I've lived in about a fourth of the states in the US and spent lot of time in the others, so I know what I'm talking about, having experienced most of them first hand.

Mail-In voting is amazing, we've done it almost exclusively in WA, and it's waaaaaay better for voter turnout and de-corrupting government than ballot voting.

There's  a double-effect that makes really useful...

1. In mail-in voting, you can still vote, even if your job schedule would screw you over. This means young voters have no problem voting, those in assisted living have no problem voting, and those working two jobs have no problem voting. It really gets out the vote.
2. Probably most dangerous to corrupt politicians, there's a special advantage to mail-in voting: the ability to research your decision while you're voting. Often, both in the midwest (which did the ballot box), you'd know one or two people you were voting on, and you go in remembering their stances on one hot-button issue. Then you see dozens of other names that you have no clue what's going on, county and city measures that leaving you scratching your head, and you just end up guessing. Since moving to WA, each ballot, I've looked at something and been like, ""What's this thing I don't understand?"" Then I google the person or bill I'm voting on, and it's like, ""Oh, that makes a lot more sense"" or ""Huh, this person I thought was decent has actually been caught taking hundreds of bribes and clubbing baby seals for fun... ya no.""

Seriously, mail-in voting is one of the three things that make WA politics best in the nation (as proved by our Coronavirus response being the best in the nation so far and everyone else who is sane trying to follow our example.)

What makes our politics work is the mail-in voting being default, having an accessible public initiative process (CA's is hard, WA's is fairly balanced, and only a few states have it) goes a loooong way to cleaning up government because we don't have to wait for politicans to get around to voting on an issue that we want now. And the third is WA residents even get to vote on all spending bills that go through to confirm or deny them during the general vote. This makes it much harder for corporations to get special benefits stolen from the voters. As a result, we keep our government here in WA efficient and focused on what matters instead of the mess in most of the rest of the U.S.",1586028411.0,5,0,,False,0,False,False,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2020,4,0.077668175

Affection and regard for your family are one thing, and are yours to dispense as you please. HOWEVER we have been letting voices of unwarranted entitlement and ignorance prevail over common courtesy and common sense for far too long. I am appalled that some ppl are assuming that you are lecturing or getting high-handed with your father over the mask issue. Has he been immersed in the demanding and rigorous study of the human body that is med school for years, as you have? Is he in fact a medical professional? No? Then why the hell should you shut up or bend over backwards coddling a dim medieval view of a simple fact of basic hygiene?

I work in elder care, and I've had one or two clients that had similar preposterous views. Because I was working for them I found myself in a position similar to yours; i.e., because of the situation and the fact that it was their home, I did not feel I ought to say everything on my mind, out of courtesy or whatever. One fucker (he really was) used to straight- up bait me. I had to learn to just let things roll off me like water off a duck. To be a truly disinterested party. To refuse to play. It's so fucking hard!

The really tragic thing is that this is the time in your life you are supposed to be away at school, getting up to all kinds of mischief and gathering life experiences which reinforce your sense of self as a thing totally separate from any negative programming from your childhood years.

It will have to extend unemployment benefits, and provide further direct cash relief, and take care of the people left out of the CARES Act, through an immediate cancellation of a minimum of $10,000 of student debt per person, as proposed by Senator Warren, and Social Security boosts. And so much more.

https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-december-2021

This is pretty comprehensive beyond the Georgia bill. But I’ll address the points on BBC.

1. Fewer drop boxes - the “counterargument” here is insane. “We didn’t used to use them, so reducing them to a fraction of the number used in 2020 is fine.” Just apply this to anything else and it’s a pretty silly argument. We have the ability to expand voting, choosing not to is restrictive…it’s literally going backwards. 

2. Voting on Sunday - they WANTED to eliminate this and only withdrew it out of external pressure…it goes to show exactly the motivating factor: to disenfranchise voters (specifically urban and black voters) without doing so *too* obviously. 

3. Water - Stymieing food/water to voters waiting on long lines is not at all mitigated by the   “but poll workers can.” That’s consolation text. They’re not the ones providing those things- it’s organized GOTV efforts.

4. Read the bottom - less time to request mail in ballots. Voter ID laws (see above: how can we target a specific group we don’t want voting, but discreetly??)

I live in a white upper-middle class community and vote without ID. I wonder why no one decries fraud here?

Regardless - the swathe of voter restriction bills and the empowerment of partisan bodies to overturn elections goes far beyond Georgia.

We need to increase access to voting, not restrict it. 

And IMO we start by making Election Day a holiday

However - as everyone knows? The Governor of your state needs to accept certain components of the ACA.

&gt;Although 18.4% of Texans were still uninsured as of 2019, a substantial number of Texas residents have obtained health coverage since the ACA was implemented. However, the number of people gaining coverage would be far higher if Texas were to accept federal funding to expand Medicaid under the ACA.

Then? The people that live in that state suffer. I'm sorry for you that you have to go through that.

&gt;Texas lawmakers noted that a state-based rate review program will allow them to ensure that health insurance companies take a uniform approach to “silver loading” the cost of cost-sharing reductions, which will increase the size of premium subsidies that Texas residents receive. S.B.1296 took effect in September 2021, but the rate review season for 2022 plans was already nearly over by that point. So the federal government finalized the rates for 2022, and the Texas Department of Insurance will take over in the spring of 2022, reviewing the rate filings that are submitted for 2023 coverage.

Because of the __recent changes__ approved by President Biden? There's nothing wrong with you trying to see what happens in regards to your eligibility and rate.

&gt;The proposed and approved rate changes only apply to full-price plans, and very few enrollees pay full price for plans that are purchased through the exchange (as of February 2021, 92% of Texas exchange enrollees were receiving premium subsidies, and that percentage increased a few months later, once the American Rescue Plan was implemented).

One of the main things we can do to push back against autocracy is to heal our system at home.

It's actually the same battle.

&gt;*Former federal prosecutor Glenn Kirschner believes former President Donald Trump and his former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows ""wanted the Capitol to be taken"" on the day of the insurrection last year.*

In order to make American democracy work, __we make it work.__

&gt;*Donald Trump, Mark Meadows, and others in Donald Trump's administration deprived the Capitol of the federal law enforcement forces it needed to defend itself,""  Kirschner said in a video posted to YouTube on Friday. ""And that, friends, leads to one pretty compelling inference. We can maybe even call it the only reasonable conclusion: That Donald Trump and Mark Meadows wanted the Capitol to be taken; that Donald Trump and Mark Meadows the angry mob to stop the certification of Joe Biden's win.""*

There is a __profound link between autocracy and corruption.__ One of the things that autocrats do, is they push back __against anybody__ who can hold them accountable.

Whether that is the media, courts, prosecutors, inspector generals, whichever __institution there in the civil service__ or the legal system that could do or say something?

They push back, they mock them, make fun of them, __take away their influence (power).__

Because __they want to get away with breaking the law__ themselves.

They are *simultaneously undermining* democracy and the rule of law.

It's not an accident that those two things go together.

&gt;*In December 2020, Reps. Matt Gaetz, Jim Jordan, and other Republican lawmakers participated in calls and meetings with Trump and his aides after he lost the 2020 presidential election, according to testimony given to the committee by Cassidy Hutchinson, who served as an aide to Meadows. Hutchinson said in the deposition records that various Republican lawmakers, including Gaetz, Jordan, Reps. Scott Perry, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Louis Gohmert, either met in person or dialed into meetings discussing ways to undo Biden's victory.*

__Pushing back against those practices,__ forcing even our highest leaders (such as current / former presidents, congress members and cabinet leaders) to __meet the consequences of their actions__ (just like other society members) is what it means to be a democracy.

&gt;*During these meetings, the Republican lawmakers explored avenues that ""could potentially be a constitutional and viable option to either stall certification of the election or to delay the inauguration or to assert that Mr. Trump had actually won,"" Hutchinson said. Other political figures agree the testimony so far has been shocking. For instance, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who serves on the Jan. 6 House panel, said the testimony brought forth before the panel will ""really blow the roof off the House.""*

It’s common for decisions to follow a political theme but respect long-standing precedent and legal norms. Recent decisions see us straying from that to what some call “legalism” — an overtly political outcome using legal dressing, but ignoring both precedent, norms and existing legal theories. Unfortunately, if you look up legalism, you’ll see the type of political systems where it’s most popular. 

The long-term down side to legalism is that it impairs the credibility of the Court. That credibility is what gives weight to implementing decisions even when unpopular with the current administration or the public. As SCOTUS popularity decreases along the lines of Congressional popularity, and some decisions (appear to) stray from moral, legal and ethical standards, it risks more than credibility: it increases the potential a more authoritarian-minded executive will feel empowered to ignore a decision.

This isn’t a purely liberal concern. Conservatives from Scalia to Roberts have voiced concern about this. And if that rubicon is crossed, SCOTUS becomes little more than a rubber stamp on the executive.",1648997742.0,4,0,,False,0,False,False,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2022,4,0.031684756

They are technically private sales in just one big place so we can call it the ""private sale loophole if that makes you feel better.

Again, there are 70 million people in the US that believe democrats flat out deny reality as well so can we not even entertain the idea that may be we are wrong in some instances? Would it not seem extremely naïve to think there is no way there is any instance in which a republican is right on an issue and a democrat wrong? If we cannot do that then we are a cult not a political party in my humble opinion.  


But let's take examples, and again I am not a republican even remotely but I do know a few instances in which democrats denied reality not anecdotally. Unless you mean anecdotal examples don't happen either in which I could go on and on haha.   


None anecdotal examples first, Biden recently called for a dead person during his speech, the white house's response was that he did not do that and he just missed this person in question. Democrats argued the same thing for days even though we all saw him do it plainly, that is denying reality right there in a funny sense, but I will be more serious.  


Democrats will also argue that abortion is all about the religious side of things and it is not killing anyone. Over 95% of biologist agree that abortion is killing a human life. Now that does not mean abortion is wrong, nor does it mean pro-life is correct, but democrats that argue ""this is not killing anyone"" is completely wrong based on the unfaltering, clear cut science that it is ending a human life. But we could still say that human isn't a person, doesn't have rights, the mother's rights trump it, whatever. But democrats openly argue the opposite at the highest level despite being entirely wrong in the science. This is again openly denying reality in order to push a political position.  


For more anecdotal evidence that may prove a larger point. I AM NOT SUPPORTING THE ELECTION FRAUD ARGUMENT AT ALL FIRST AND FOREMOST. During the 2020 election my vote was lost. What I mean is in my state you can actually track your vote. It was submitted that night and the following morning was missing. This happened to 8 of my family members across 2 states. We all called and were essentially told over and over again that ""we never voted in the 2020 election as there is no ballot"". I can promise you as someone how has voted before there was no error. It was filled out and submitted and in the case of error they would actually still have my ballot. So for 7 of us our ballot was never found and our vote not counted, one of us continued pushing for a week by calling everywhere they could, at the end of the week they found the ballot and submitted it. This did happen to me. I believe it was not malicious, I believe it was poor organization by my state and true human error, however I can understand why some republicans think this is some great fraud because they lost. On the other hand I have been told that is just an entirely made up story by democrats who refuse to accept the reality that something like this can happen. But the reality is my vote was lost in the 2020 election and if it was counted I was never confirmed that it did so I just have to wonder if my vote mattered. Now the majority of the elected officials I voted for in my state were elected anyway so I never worried tooooo much about my vote haha.",1672689994.0,-1,0,,False,0,False,False,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2023,1,0.11036996

I think people transitioning and becoming the gender they want to be is fantastic, but in competitive sports at any level, people born male will have an advantage over people born female.  Unless the transition began before puberty, which is obviously a whole other controversial topic.

My favorite sport is disc golf.  There was a pretty recent controversy involving this.  It ended up leading to the sport's governing body, the PDGA, making a rule that male to female transgender players cannot compete in the Female professional division in the sport's ""biggest"" tournaments unless they began to transition before puberty.

They can still compete in the Female division in lower tier tournaments if transitioning after puberty, but they have to prove that their testosterone levels are below a certain threshold, and that they have been taking the gender affirming hormone therapy for at least 24 months prior to playing.

To me, this is completely fair.  It allows MtF transgender athletes to compete as females in A-tier events and below.  A-tiers are not ""major"" tournaments, but you need to be an extremely talented disc golfer to be competitive in one at the open/pro level.  Winning an A-tier tournament is still a prestigious thing.  Also, a man can't just say ""I'm transitioning,"" begin HRT, and start competing as a female right away.

For reference, the vast majority of men that are competitive disc golfers would not be able to win an A-tier event competing only against women, or even get close.",1674806666.0,3,0,,1674808352.0,0,False,False,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2023,1,0.09438288

""I'm not racist"" is prob the #1 reason ppl vote Biden. ""I don't like traitors and rapists"" follows closely.

President Biden fought for and signed the American Rescue Plan which protected workers’ pensions, provided funding to communities and businesses devastated by COVID-19, lowered or eliminated insurance premiums for millions of lower- and middle-income families, provided funds for affordable housing, provided money for public safety and crime reduction, provided support to small business, expanded food assistance programs in homes and schools, expanded child care programs, invested in mental health and health care centers, added $40 billion for investing in American workers, provided funding to the economies of tribal nations, and supported families with children. Child poverty has already been cut in half as a result of his efforts.

He signed a $1 trillion infrastructure bill to repair our roads, waterways, bridges and railroads, and bring high-speed internet to rural communities. Also included is money for public transit and airports, electric vehicles and low emission public transportation, power infrastructure, and clean water.

Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. This law provides incentives for states to pass red flag laws, expands the law that prevents people convicted of domestic abuse from gun ownership, expands background checks on young people between 18 and 21 who want to buy a gun, and allocates funds for the mental health of young people.

He instituted an executive order raising standards for law enforcement agencies, with particular emphasis on use-of-force policies, availability of body cameras, and recruitment and retention of officers.

He brought the unemployment rate down to a low of 3.5%, matching the lowest rate before the pandemic. It has now climbed a bit to 3.8%, but this compares very favorably to the rates of other countries throughout the world. Biden’s administration has added 13.2 million jobs since he came into office, replacing all of the jobs that were lost at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. Today there are more people in America working today than ever before!

He signed a bill to help veterans who have long been suffering from the effects of burn pits.

Biden ended the war in Afghanistan, the longest war in U.S. history. Over 120,000 people were safely evacuated, double the number calculated by the most optimistic experts.

He has steadfastly supported Ukraine after this democratic country was unjustly invaded by Putin and Russia, and has successfully led the free world by lobbying NATO and other allies to add their financial and military support.

He signed the Inflation Reduction Act, making health insurance plans more affordable, lowering drug costs, preventing millions of Americans from losing their Affordable Care Act insurance, and requiring Medicare to negotiate the cost of 10 high-cost prescription drugs.

Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act, providing funding to produce semiconductor chips for automobiles, cellphones, laptops, gaming consoles, washing machines, etc. here in the Unites States rather than continuing to rely on China.

His administration has provided over $369 million to reduce greenhouse emissions by 40% in the next seven years and promote clean energy technologies, moving our country to greater self-sufficiency in energy production.

He signed the Postal Service Reform Act to modernize and stabilize the U.S. Post Office and also to help it continue to deliver mail six days every week, focusing on on-time delivery.

Other accomplishments include the reestablishment of respect among our allies on the world stage, the Violence Against Women Act, the Respect for Marriage Act, pardoning those convicted of simple marijuana possession, appointing Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson (the first Black woman on the Supreme Court), forgiving certain student loans, and electoral reforms to ensure that election results are not undermined.",1706711452.0,2,0,,False,0,False,False,Liberal,t5_2qxt5,2024,1,0.31547862

What can be done is to get the 11th Circuit to fire her ass. Cannon is being expertly coached, IMO. She began a long line of non-order orders that she issues via emails instead of on paper. It's a total abuse of the system and appears to be a loophole.

Jack Smith has recognized since last September that this trial will never happen before the election. What he's been waiting for is a paper order he can take to the 11th Circuit to reverse her and likely get her off the case. She filed one once, but then reversed it to keep herself safe. This newest filing from him looks like it might be the one, because he's spelled out she is now the defendant of her order and it is required she answer for herself, because as her order stands it will force a mistrial that cannot be appealed. He also has informed her he will perform a Writ of Mandamus if she does not answer, which is a nuclear option where he goes above her for a ruling.

Yep. Already explained it to you.

>1/3 of the families of the south had a direct hand in the practice of slavery, and even more had one indirectly. We have direct accounts and diaries from southern soldiers, rich and poor alike, describing their own interests in slavery.

Correct. Being part of a slave owning system is not the same as owning a slave. Frankly the average southerner was no less racist than the averager northerner. This was mostly a fight between the elites - the south to keep their economy (rich dudes get rich for doing nothing) and the north to keep the country together.

I've seen things here on reddit that make me feel like there is a possibility that votes could be changed if the tabulation programs were altered months ago in an if/then command for Nov 5 specifically. That the same machine could give completely accurate results every time it was tested, until the time when it actually counted. And back to accurate afterward.

Maybe that's what people on the right were saying 4 years ago...

It's really hard to not sound like a hypocrite when everyone on the left preemptively declared that the system was secure.

What was proposed in that thread was to look at precincts where the results were way off of what was expected, especially in heavily red areas. It would be easier to make a red precinct more red than to turn a blue one red. Then do a handful of handcount comparisons to the tabulated results to see if they match.
