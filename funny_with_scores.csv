Note that I had already made rooming arrangements, costumes, days off work, etc. Now this lady judge comes in and gives us a speech at the beginning about how she has never in her entire career let anyone be excused from a court date blah blah blah. Then she asked if any ""brave souls"" out there think they have a good enough reason to be excused. I had to literally beg this lady judge to let me be excused from this case in front of everybody. Nobody knew what I was talking about and I explained it as a, ""...a giant nerdfest where we all wear costumes and talk about how great star wars and comic books are! It is a massive convention, how has nobody in here heard about this?!"" At this, she, the lawyers, and even the two dudes being tried laughed at me. 

She then asked if I had really made a costume, and I replied yes and then lied about how difficult and expensive it was to make. At this she smiled again and replied, ""Well, I am going to excuse you, but only because you are the first person I have heard of to make a costume for an event you described as a 'nerdfest'."" 

With that I thanked her and quickly left the courtroom and might as well have skipped to my car because I was so happy.

You're missing my point.  There are basically three kinds of advertising.

1) 'Pure' advertising: for example a guy buys some land next to a road and puts up a billboard.  This is the kind of advertising I'm against: only the guy benefits and everyone else is (slightly) negatively affected.

2) Subsidizing advertising: A subscription to *The Economist* newspaper cost about $100 a year -- and it still has ads.  The existence of those ads allows the subscription cost to be lower than it otherwise would be.  Obviously the subscriptions + advertising makes *The Economist* profitable, which is great for the people who subscribe so that it can continue to exist.  The advertising on the London Underground also falls into this category.

3) Service-supported advertising.  This is sites like YouTube: you don't pay to use them but YouTube has to pay their workers and YouTube also pays partners [like me](http://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey) to make videos that people want to watch.  Again, obviously YouTube is profitable and partners make money from the ads.  That's how YouTube and content creators can exist in the first place.  Blocking ads on sites like this isn't exactly stealing, but it's failing to support the service you use.  ",1349290758,2,funny,2012-10,0.03192045

cetft8f,t1_cetf8ry,t3_1vk8ys,kundarsa,"with my time on the road im under the impression that when you experience country farm land driving vs city hussle and bustle traffic. you prefer the country. its got a good smooth pace, not many cars on the road (i can drive i94 through eastern Montanan for 30 minutes before seeing another vehicle on the opposite side of the interstate). no one has much to do so their day consists of doing 1 or 2 things max so they have lots of extra time and usually leave really early cause they have nothing else to-do and don't mind sitting around chatting before what ever it is takes place. i've seen drivers start out with a poor attitude but through driving professionally they learn we are all going the same direction, and we just wanna make sure that in the end we got there safely. 

i remember heading west needing to go through chicago. somehow i thought i was hitting chicago at 5am. was on the road for a while and realized i was hitting chicago at 8am. called up dispatch told them i was gonna be way late. if they wanted this load on time they needed another driver on the other side of chicago to swap with me (it was heading to west wisconsin). chicago at 3am can be a thirty minute drive. it took me 3 hours before the roads opened up. im stopped in traffic, haven't even seen the express lanes come up yet (which i cant use) and dispatch called me. my entire load of 43,000 pounds of soup is going to a grocery store (thats too much soup for 1 store). they are having a huge huge sale and couldn't order it later at the lower cost. i now need to get it there within 3 days (its only 1 day of driving). dispatch tells me i can deliver anytime within the 3 days and the sooner i do, the sooner i can get a new load. so i am in no hurry whats so ever. im going 2mph while everyone else is going 7. entire on ramps are emptying out in-front of me with this huge following distance i have. the whole time a flat bed truck same lane as me is yelling on the radio because he cant make his delivery on time. hes popping the clutch (lurching forward hard rocking the truck). slamming on his breaks. i cant see a gap between the front of his truck and the back of the car he is behind with the shadows on the shoulder from the early morning sun. the whole drive through chicago he didn't let a single car in (impressive but extremely dangerous). once we got out of chicago road opened up and we hammered down to the speed limit. he gained half a mile ahead of me after those 3 hours. which at 60 is 30 seconds. not worth the risk. us truck drivers experience this, we experience close hazardous situations with other vehicles. we get a little edgy, we get a little cautious. we are professionals and in the end i like to hope our caring for the lives around us encourage us to keep you safe in your car.",1390148344,1,funny,2014-01,0.02779579

We didn't always though, marriage is a lot of work and it takes time to get to know your spouse in a way that fosters this kind of environment and is dependent on your willingness to put in the effort.  The main problem that people in a marriage face when desiring sex and not getting it (aside from sexual issues in the past affecting the other person) is usually themselves, however they are unwilling to admit it and rather focus the blame on the other person.  A husband that is unwilling to love his wife in the way that she needs it and to treat here with care, gentleness and kindness should not be surprised when she doesn't desire to be an active participate in their sex life, yet that is exactly how most men act.  Be men, treat your woman the way she needs to be treated and in time results will come (women are not an off/on switch).",1389909277,3,funny,2014-01,0.23812068

The King has been pushed back and we see him, back to the wall in his own throne room, the doors are being battered to splinters. All hope is nearly gone and when the Uruks breach the final gate the king leads his handful of remaining troops forward with the cry ""Forth Eorlingas!""

Smashing through the hallways and corridors you see the dozen or so men, every one of them wounded, emerge from the bastion and ride down the causeway. A mere handful of horsemen and single valiant banner man ride forward into a veritable ocean of pike wielding Uruk. 

On the far saddle pass Gandalf rides forward and says, his voice with equal measure pride and despair, ""Theoden stands alone.""

And then Eomer pulls his horse up along side and say ""Not alone."" - you hear a horn cry - and a rank upon rank of horses pull even with him and he cries out ""Rohirrim, **to the king!**

This is how it should be taught anyway instead of as a bunch of disconnected facts that don't seem to have anything to do with one another. Instead of teaching 1 x 2, 1 x 3 ... 9 x 1, 9 x 2, etc. and expecting kids to use rote memorization it would be easier to just show them the table and then have them, as a group, find the different patterns within it. Make a game out of it. A couple of hours of doing this and they'd probably have most of the table memorized without even trying and then you could work on individual multiplication facts that the class is fuzzy on.

We assume the existence of a lot of things we can't prove. I used to cite the higgs-boson, but we proved that to a degree of near certainty. So instead, we assume the existence of a singularity at the center of super massive gravity clusters, but can't prove it.

cltaic8,t1_clsalba,t3_2l2hgd,StarHarvest,"&gt;Many of your arguments have and continue to be based around what you are admitting to be purposeful misreadings and hyperbolic generalities.

Your use of the terms ""misreadings"" and ""hyperbolic"" are very questionable here. You see, I am not criticizing feminist literature directly, I am criticizing the cultural fallout of prejudice that has caused detachment from the original message (although I take issue with many feminist scholars; but that's another story). You assume that because I haven't drawn identical conclusions to you from reading feminist rhetoric that I must have ""misread"" the text, and that stems from an inability to accept conflicting opinions. You say that I've used hyperbole, but as stated, I am more than willing to cite feminist journalists, bloggers, and maybe book authors that have given me reason to be credulous of this. You're simply repeating your notion that I don't understand Feminism while citing no substantial evidence. This is also based on the fallacy that Feminism is an ideology of consensus, which it is not.   

&gt;representation in leadership      

Women make up the majority of the electorate and are fully capable and allowed to run for office or any position of power.    

&gt; economic factors     
 
If we're still talking about patriarchy, I assume you're referring to the ""wage gap theory"" which has been debunked by everybody with even the most basic economic literacy, if you would like an explanation and dozens of sources I will provide them.  

&gt; incarceration rates   

Men are incarcerated more than women, that's actually an argument against patriarchy theory. But if you're referring to minorities; in the U.S. minorities are more likely to be poor and tend to reside in crime ridden areas. This is an issue of poverty and culture, not racism or sexism.   

&gt;rates of violences   

Men are more likely to be victims of violence and whites are most likely to be victims of interracial violence.

Let me clear this up. I do not deny the existence of privilege. Every race and gender enjoys different privileges and vices. This concept is, however, *not* owned by feminism. One does not need to be feminist to analyze their own privileges and advantages in society; feminism simply teaches society that women and are incapable of having privilege (which is a composition fallacy). Yes, yes, you can argue that many feminist scholars do not say exactly this, but the bastardization of the ideology has resulted in this widespread belief. Again, if you need sources or examples I will provide them.

&gt;Sorry, but cherry picking is easy and undercut by over a decade of involvement in feminist activism and scholarship in numerous cities and across a handful of different social forums.

Ah I see, of course. So how many examples would I need to give you before it ceases to be ""cherry picking"" and becomes an actual issue within the movement? A dozen? One hundred? Also, please explain under what conditions the key feminist theories of feminism: *patriarchy* and *rape culture* can be disproven. Because if you're constantly using prescriptive language rather than descriptive, that's a non-argument.",1415155094,1,funny,2014-11,0.15822013

Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge introvert, but a lot of people seem incredibly hesitant to take that first step of introducing themselves to a random person, when it can honestly really enhance an experience.

Not speaking the language is another matter and totally understandable, especially since you likely won't know the customs either, so someone may very well not understand that thrusting an expensive camera/phone into their hands is a request that you take a picture as opposed to a gift!

&gt;Please don't ever change!

I think know what you mean by that but I must respectfully refuse; we should all strive to be better people, to better understand other viewpoints and experiences, and to learn as much as we can about this crazy, beautiful, terrible, wonderful world that we live it. 

I would not have always had the same response to that; in my younger days, I was a lot more judgemental and quick to anger, though I still have times where I am too quick to respond emotionally. I'm not really sure what caused that change (or why), but I think studying some philosophy in college helped widen my perspective.

Actually you don't. Market for Lemons economic theory shows why. For health insurance there is a lot of unknows which affect the probability of you needing it in the future. The insurance company doesn't know all of these, so they price it based on average health. But then those who are better than average health are getting ripped off, so any of them who are logical are going to opt out if possible. Well now the average health of people getting insurance is a low lower, and that causes more to opt out etc. Eventually it means that it's priced as if you are way below average health.

If everyone is forced into it, then the average health is actually the average health of the citizen. This means that the insurance company can price it based on average health. Of course the insurance company still is going to want to make a profit, but as long as it's not a monopoly, or it's a government run monopoly then the prices should be lower in the long run.",1443215769,1,funny,2015-09,0.049089402

 American is only a nationality because it's not full of human beings who've been living in the same spot for tens of thousands of years, Native Americans excepted.

Clearly everyone has an ethnicity, so it must follow that Americans are made up of the ethnicities of their ancestors. This is why when you ask an American what they are, they think you are asking about ethnicity. Asking Europeans the same question makes them think you are asking about nationality, since for the most part those two aren't separated in their country. Also why Irish people get pissed off about Americans claiming to be Irish- they don't understand the context of the answer from an American perspective. They're not claiming to be the same kind of Irish as you are, they're saying that all (or most) of their ancestors originated in Ireland.

e29mnig,t1_e29lg00,t3_8y0pqj,[deleted],"&gt; I'm selfish
Failing to meet consumers half way is just begging for them to boycott ridiculous demands.  For example there was once no less than 5 separate recycling bins on offer to store inside crowded houses and to coordinate with pick ups.  That didn't work at all (to no one's surprise) until they paid for a proper facility that can sort all recyclables automatically. Now everyone recycles and the system works.

&gt; All in hearing is

Well all I'm hearing is you get off imposing things on others to subtly piss them off. That and you value self-flagellation over actually fixing problems.  Do you really care about the environment or do you really care about people thinking your better than them because you 'care about the environment'?

&gt; I believe that all of the trash that I use and throw out and recycle doesn't add to the problem in a measurable way
  
If a straw I've thrown out has made it into the ocean then someone hasn't done the job they have been paid to do.  If that is the problem then we should be looking at that, not banning straws.

&gt; I'm good to continue to consume plastic and encourage its production 

Plastic is one of the most versatile, affordable and adjustable materials there is.  Governments failing to provide positive incentives to encourage good behaviour from consumers and companies doesn't mean we throw away one of the core tools that makes our lives good.

Soon all poverty and homelessness is gone, and the earth becomes a utopia, only knowing feelings of pure happiness. Soon aliens come and visit us, giving us unimaginable riches all because we “realized the truth”.

Im all for everyone getting paid during these trying times, I agree that if people are able to work and collect pay, more power to you.

But the fact that the business owner was pretending like he was operating the store with his employees welfare as his first priority is bullshit. Im 100% sure he is still making a nice profit on top of his salary. Their paychecks are an externality of his profit, not a priority.

The fact is, people don't like being told what to do, and will hide behind 'their rights' when it is just a matter of personal responsibility to wear a mask, and try to keep from gathering in crowds for a little while.

Dragon with girl tattoo-- really!
Any time someone asks me what I'm reading and I give the title of this book, they correct me, thinking I meant the more widely known ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" This is a spoof and a satire and very enjoyable read. These dragons are so intelligent that one tends to forget while reading that they are dragons, until the author mentions what they do when they meet new dragons. They maneuver around trying to sniff one another's buts, just like certain other animals. These dragons spend their life trying to accumulate more gold to hoard, and any dragon who does not is known to be in need of a legal guardian. The author has managed some commentary on life while the reader laughs over the characters of the dragons.”

If it's a piece this big (and with enough people) we would carry the couch while standing on its side and have people pull from on top and push up from the bottom enough to stabilize it on the railing and carry it up the rest of the way with no turns. To bring it down, first stabilize the item on rail at the first turn at the top then lower it while people at the bottom catch and bring it down. A good method for when there aren't enough people to help is to use ratchet straps to raise and lower the item as needed; this method works best when bringing the item down as it doesn't require as much physical strength as bringing it up.",1633923116,1153,funny,2021-10,0.029563503

Uh... it's absolutely true, there are a lot of people in LGBT spaces who kick off if someone so much as looks at them. You have loads of people who have huge chips on their shoulder about their gender or sexuality, and can't tolerate even the slightest banter. Many LGBT people read others but can't cope with being read themselves.

Queer people are just people, and some of us are rotted. Some queer people are over-sensitive assholes. Some queer people have troubled upbringings are lash out.

>We just don't think dehumanising depreciations a la ""attack helicopter"" actually qualifies as jokes.

What kind of 'no true scotsman' semantic gymnastics is this? ""No queer people is intolerant of jokes, because things I find offensive don't count as jokes""?

No, ""attack helicopter"" jokes are jokes. You're free to find those jokes dehumanising or offensive, but they're still jokes.

>This, a simple wordplay? All good, hombre.
