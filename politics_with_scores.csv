c4hcp4i,t3_svmy3,t3_svmy3,The_Law_of_Pizza,"All of those measures were doomed to failure anyway.

It doesn't matter how difficult you make it to get the high-calorie foods. The kids are still going to choose them over the vegetables, because the pizza and chicken nuggets *taste better*. It's as simple as that. You're never, ever going to be able to get kids to willingly *choose* the vegetables and low-calorie options. You have to force them. 

But I'm not suggesting that. I'm a picky eater myself, and I wouldn't want anybody telling *me* what I can and can't eat, so I wouldn't wish it on the kids.

The real solution is two fold: 1) more physical activity, and 2) getting the parents to cut out soda at home (at least on weekdays). 

Our diets aren't that terribly different from what we ate in the 60's and 70s, and yet our obesity rates have skyrocketed - why is that? The only difference is that every decade we get more and more sedentary. Most kids don't ride a bike or walk to school anymore, they're dropped off by car. Most kids don't have more than a short period of PE for a semester. Most kids are gaming now instead of playing outside. And there's nothing wrong with any of those things individually, but added together they turn a kid's life upside down from what it would have looked like 30-40 years ago. They just sit. Everywhere. They sit while traveling, they sit at their destination, they sit during recreation. 

The second part, the soda, is simply because of its deceptively high-calorie nature. The vast majority of people don't even think about soda as a source of weight gain, or at least a significant source of it - but the truth is that many people will pack in more calories from their drinks than entire meals. If you drink a soda in the morning to wake up, a soda with lunch, and then a soda with dinner - that's roughly 700 calories (assuming bottles instead of cans - but with cans it's still approaching 500). Basically, an entire meal added onto your daily caloric intake. But you don't think about it that way because it was just liquid, and spaced apart throughout the day. That is its insidious trap - one that way too many kids fall into, and mostly because even their parents simply don't know any better. ",1335551800,2,politics,2012-04,0.08874765

""Third, DEA’s examination of the legislative history of 
§ 823(a) is flawed.  In response to Petitioner’s brief (at 41-43), the 
agency now abandons its reliance on language from the Narcotics 
Manufacturing Act of 1960, see 74 Fed. Reg. 2128 (Add. 128), and with 
good reason.  The 1960 Act stated that DEA should consider limiting 
new registrants to “the smallest number of establishments which will 
provide an adequate an uninterrupted supply,” but Congress removed
the “smallest number of establishments” language when it passed the 
Controlled Substances Act.  The statute now states that DEA should 
“consider” limiting registrants to “a number”—not the smallest one—
that can produce adequate supply under competitive conditions.  See 
Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 397 (1995) (amendments to a statute are 
presumed to have “real and substantial effect”).     
      
**DEA now attempts read “the smallest number” back into the 
statute by quoting language from the Senate Report from a draft (and 
not enacted) version of the Controlled Substances Act.**  The draft states that the Attorney General “must limit the importation and manufacture of schedules I and II substances to a number of establishments which can produce an adequate an uninterrupted supply under adequately competitive conditions for legitimate purposes.”  (DEA Br. 39 (quoting S.

### User Terms of Service And the Expectation of Privacy **BEWARE**

The Sixth Circuit acknowledged that, for a subpoena to issue, the Government must meet only the lower “reasonableness standard.” However, in reviewing the case law, the court concluded that individuals may challenge a third party subpoena before disclosure is compelled if they have a “legitimate expectation of privacy” regarding the records at issue. The Warshak court therefore reasoned that, where an email user has an expectation of privacy regarding the email content, the government must meet the more rigorous “probable cause” standard. The court found an expectation of privacy in e-mail communications by analogizing the emails to the surveillance of telephone conversations at issue in Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967). In Katz, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the government interception of telephone conversations was a search for Fourth Amendment purposes, and that individuals have a legitimate expectation of privacy regarding the conversations.  
 
The Sixth Circuit made only one modification to the district court’s injunction, adding that, “if the government can show, based on specific facts, that an e-mail account holder has waived his expectation of privacy via-a-vis the ISP, compelled disclosure of e-mails through notice to the ISP alone would be appropriate.” The Court explained such a waiver requires more than the ISP having some level of monitoring policies in place. For example, an ISP’s terms of use reserving a right of access to e-mail communications for specific, limited purposes or its use of technological monitoring of e-mails to identify child pornography, would not constitute a waiver by the subscriber. Rather, for a subscriber to waive his expectation of privacy in e-mail communications, the ISP would have to have clear terms of service apparent to the user allowing it to regularly audit, inspect, or monitor subscriber e-mails.

### **Obama and the Cloud**
The Obama administration is urging Congress not to adopt legislation that would impose constitutional safeguards on Americans’ e-mail stored in the cloud.
the Obama administration testified that imposing constitutional safeguards on e-mail stored in the cloud would be an unnecessary burden on the government. Probable-cause warrants would only get in the government’s way.
James A. Baker, associate deputy attorney general, testified:
&gt;Congress should recognize the collateral consequences to criminal law enforcement and the national security of the United States if ECPA were to provide only one means — a probable cause warrant — for compelling disclosure of all stored content. For example, in order to obtain a search warrant for a particular e-mail account, law enforcement has to establish probable cause to believe that evidence will be found in that particular account. In some cases, this link can be hard to establish. In one recent case, for example, law enforcement officers knew that a child exploitation subject had used one account to send and receive child pornography, and officers discovered that he had another email account, but they lacked evidence about his use of the second account.

The judiciary, however, has taken a different course. A federal appeals court in December ruled that e-mails were protected by the warrant requirement.

That decision by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals became law March 21. It affects Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee.

### **Criminal Penalties**
The ICA officers and employees whose email was accessed went on to sue Farey-Jones and his attorney under the civil provisions of three federal privacy and computer protection laws, but a federal judge threw out the lawsuit. The 9th Circuit partially reversed that ruling last August, finding that the subpoena didn't violate federal wiretap law, but could constitute a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Stored Communications Act (SCA), which outlaw unauthorized access to computers and stored email respectively.
Although the ruling addressed a civil suit, both laws include criminal penalties. That means civil attorneys issuing overbroad subpoenas - not an uncommon event - now risk lawsuits, and even potential criminal prosecution as computer intruders, under the decision. ***[L: BUT THE ECPA WILL BE INVALIDATED AND SUPERSEDED BY THE CURRENTLY PROPOSED CYBER BILLS!]***

""In my view, the 9th Circuit decision... potentially criminalizes a broad swath of conduct,"" says San Francisco attorney Robert White, who represented Farey-Jones in the appeal. Electronic civil libertarians were split over the decision, seeing it as good for privacy, but a tempting tool for abuse by zealous prosecutors or litigious companies.

You seem to infer that you can find similar care in the rest of the world that you can find in the US. I would completely disagree. Give me your top 10-top 15 doctors in all fields. I (who in fairness, have not looked this up ahead of time) would look at the top 10 in each of those fields and be confident that the majority of those experts practice in the US.

It's not a question of are there competent doctors in other countries, there are without a doubt an extreme amout of well-qualified and in some cases, better qualified than their American counterparts. But that misses the point again that the US healthcare system suffers from insurance woes and not from experts in their fields. 

Let's look at your statement. ""you might learn that supply and demand are the basic factors driving an economy. If there is a demand for doctors, then people will try to fill that demand, starting with locals and then including foreign nationals. Keeping in mind the fact that only 65,000 people are allowed to come to the US on an H1B visa every year, you might find that locals tend to fill positions more often than foreigners.""

So if I get this right you talk about supply and demand from one side but forget that there is a completely different side from the expert doctors? Yes there are more local doctors here than foreigners however due to the amount of money in the health care industry in the US, the specialists in their field are going to be drawn to come to hospitals in the US.

Here's a chart of how much we pay(2009) vs how much doctors make in other countries. [Source](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/how-much-do-doctors-in-other-countries-make/)

Supply and demand? I'd say specialists are in very short supply and demand is high which would mean they can pick and choose where they would like to utilize their services.

Secondly Monet's and Dalis are not expensive because they are popular. They are expensive because the majority of people recognize them as quality art. It's not a question of do I want to be treated by the best or the most popular but a question of do I want to be treated by someone with a small track record or one that the majority of people have found to be at the top of their game.

Simplistic worldview? I think you are ignoring the fact that humans are in general very self-centered and greedy and are going to go where it best serves their own interests. If that is simplistic, I'm not going to deny it.",1356761957,1,politics,2012-12,0.041172907

He wasn't saying that American Democracy was what needed to be spread, and yes I'm aware of how taking the claim that that was what actually was being attempted to be spread is naive. Instead Hitchens was talking about the real problem of a totalitarian dictator is. He also made the same arguments you did about the particular case of Iraq and Saddam and how he broke every international law put in place that gives reason for invasion. Hitchens argued that if there is to be international law there has to be consequences to breaking that law, otherwise it is pointless to have.

So again I'm confused as to how he can be called a neo-con. They came to the same conclusion in regards to Iraq, but how they got there was very different and that matters. Additionally Neo-cons as they are constructed in America is not a single issue group, and Hitchens wouldn't come to the same ends as them on most if not all other issues. 

It is also important to note that Hitchens wasn't simply arguing for the destruction of a popular governmental structure, but one that was highly oppressive, killed its own people and there was clearly an interest in removal of Saddam. Part of the reason he fought so hard on the issue was his personal relationships to people in Iraq who were fighting for their freedoms. He wasn't for imposing Western ideas that weren't present in the area, but for freeing those ideas that were already there from the yoke of a dictator. ",1355653223,3,politics,2012-12,0.16098402

They went from full time employees on set schedules to part time on floating schedules, did their best to get rid of the seasoned full timers, lowered their hiring age from 18 to 16, lowered their starting wages from $2 over minimum down to minimum, then cut out employee niceties like the annual Christmas party or sales rewards.

I left about three years after the new CEO got there and went over to Borders. Then the exact same thing happened at Borders.

Targeting tea party organizations because they are more likely to commit tax exemption fraud is not at all unlike targeting blacks because they are more likely to commit murder, or targeting anarchists or Muslims or Libertarians or gay rights advocates because they are more likely to commit [insert crime here].

As a non-american it worries me that the American government asks the people to take solace in the fact that they ONLY spy on people who aren't citizens. We still have rights of free speech and though they may not be covered in the american constitution they are covered in ours. 

I don't know whats worse: the fact that the american government is so open about spying on the citizens of other countries or the fact that my government hasn't done anything about it. 
Or maybe they have, and I wouldn't know about it. Which is worrying in itself because i wouldn't know whether or not to trust my own government to put my rights over relations with the most powerful country in the world. 
I wouldn't even be allowed to know if they had done something or not, again, because the information is classified. 

The only thing left for me to do now is to put my trust in the people of America and the people of the world, who, ironically, are the ones democratic governments are supposed to be representing and be a part of.

What I'd like to see come from a major change:

* Majority speakers should not be able to prevent a vote. If the house would just call for a vote today this would probably be over with.
* Multi-party system, get rid of the two-party system
* A law that forces reelections if congress cannot pass a budget
* Get money out of politics, and being able to effectively run for office shouldn't mean you need to be wealthy first.

Just those few things would be great steps, unfortunately the people running the show don't want change, they want to keep their jobs at all cost. John Boehner won't call a vote in the house for one reason only, he's afraid he'll lose his position as majority speaker of the house. That alone is worth holding the government hostage over?

You are imputing sentiments to me I didn't express.  What's *really* childish and ignorant is subsituting personal attacks for an actual argument. If you have a thesis to present, do so.  Otherwise you sound like a caviling asshole with an unearned superiority complex. 

EXAMPLES OF GRADATIONS OF EVIL:

-Snatching a old lady's purse, stealing her pension check in the process: Slightly evil.  

-Doing the above, then murdering said old lady: More evil.

-Raping her as well:  Even more so.

-Doing all of the above to multiple people:  Really fucking evil.



It is axiomatic that businesses doing what is best for their bottom line isn't always good for society at large.  By extension, sometimes that will result in evil things happening, whether through negligence or malice.

Since I evidently have to spoon-feed you after all:

 - The Bhopal disaster is a great example of short-term efficiency  (Union Carbide saving cash by cutting corners on maintenance) leading to evil (the needless death of thousands). 

 - Ford's Pinto debacle is another great example of consideration for the bottom line trumping decency and leading to evil.

In 1983, the wealthy were paying higher taxes. Since the FICA tax has a cutoff after which you pay nothing, no idea what it was in 83, this does have an effect of shifting the burden to the wealthy. They only payed FICA up to say, $75k, but they would pay back the T-Bills on 100% of their income. 

I'm OK with that.

He wants people to infer a racist agenda in the issuing of these tickets. Not just anyone with internet access can get local data, you have to physically be that location to initially acquire said data which is what I meant by local. For instance, I used to work for Google and we were all about data. We used information from street view in maps, cell phone location data, user comments and reports, and last but not least satellite imagery to help verify all that data. We always defaulted to what the people driving the street view cars said because they were physically there and could provide the most accurate data available.

I say you do reflect the views of the 1400+ redditors who upvoted your pointless comment, similarly missing any clue of the subject in question, but still feel it important to impress the rest of us with a thoughtless, pointless, insulting anecdote.

-------

Bizzaro time.  Usually in this situation you want to ask questions in order to be less clueless and, perhaps more important to you, *appear* less clueless next time this subject comes up.

- **For example**: *""Where would we even begin to change this situation?""*

- **Another example:** *""Have we had a situation this bad in this regard in our nation's history?  And if so, how did we handle this?""*

- **A third example**: *""What events occurred that lead us to having such little power over our own government, which claims in its very doctrine to serve the 'general welfare' rather than being subservient to individual, private interests?""*

*You see,* when you ask pointed questions, not only does it direct a discussion in the direction that could prove to be productive (ie. informative) toward the topic of this thread.  But *usually,* it even causes the one asking the pointed questions (yes, you!) to *appear* to be quite brilliant for that moment!

Why I'll bet you're wondering, *""This fella sure sounds like quite the smart ass!""*  However, it's sure to surprise you that: *I'm not even that smart of a person at all!*  I'm just considerate to those around me.  That's all it takes.

They count. I mistook your meaning as I said.

&gt;If I suggest anything about a free market, it gets called a 'religious belief' or otherwise ridiculed with no attempts made at a discussion.

Because it is a religious belief by definition. A free market **by definition** is a hypothetical abstraction which can not possibly ever exist.

Most of the time when libertarians say free market they mean unregulated market. An unregulated market can not ever possibly work to approximate a free market and will always lead to one person owning everything.

So, no discussion is the right course to take on the topic of free markets since either way they can never be viably implemented in the real worls.

&gt;. I honestly don't know why people like you do this. You're not changing minds. 

Well, I'm unlikely to ever change your mind. You can't reason a person out of a view reason didn't get them into. Other people reading this might find the ideas helpful.

Here's a good article I read recently about how frightened and sensitive Millennials are...

[Generation Wuss](http://www.vanityfair.fr/culture/livre/articles/generation-wuss-by-bret-easton-ellis/15837)

&gt; ......people won’t like you, that person may not love you back, kids are really cruel, work sucks, it’s hard to be good at something, life is made up of failure and disappointment, you’re not talented, people suffer, people grow old, people die. And Generation Wuss responds by collapsing into sentimentality and creating victim narratives rather than acknowledging the realities of the world and grappling with them and processing them and then moving on, better prepared to navigate an often hostile or indifferent world that doesn’t care if you exist.
___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; ...when Millennials are criticized for this content they seem to collapse into a shame spiral and the person criticizing them is automatically labeled a hater, a contrarian, a troll. And then you have to look at the generation that raised them, that coddled them in praise—gold medals for everyone, four stars for just showing up—and tried to shield them from the dark side of life, and in turn created a generation that appears to be super confident and positive about things but when the least bit of darkness enters into their realm they become paralyzed and unable to process it.",1412016228,1,politics,2014-09,0.31132057

The change has been gradual and it did come in with the 80s and Reagan. I'm lucky to know some people in their 90s and even the conservatives seem to think we got carried away with the whole 'get a job' thing. If a society gets really good at leaving people without wages, no one has customers. One of the difficulties is that any attempt to help someone is predicated on the idea that 'something is better than nothing.' It's not true though. When people don't have the means to life and never see an improvement, then participation just becomes one big bad long beatdown.

In principle there is nothing wrong with this. In practice it leads to big problems. How are we going to define ""worst""?  Will it be by test scores? We all know the problem with tests and how they are rarely a good indication of how much a student understands and learns. Also this could lead to teachers teaching to the test instead concepts and fundamentals. For instance these early fundamentals are essential for advanced math concepts but are time consuming to teach and show no improvement on basic algebra.  

I agree there needs to a better way to evaluate and compensate teachers than by only looking at tenure but blanket ""pay the best, fire the worst"" statements completely misses the boat.

Brigham Young sure thinks that God does. Look at these quotes:

&gt;You may inquire of the intelligent of the world whether they can tell why the aborigines of this country are dark, loathsome, ignorant, and sunken into the depths of degradation ...When the Lord has a people, he makes covenants with them and gives unto them promises: then, if they transgress his law, change his ordinances, and break his covenants he has made with them, he will put a mark upon them, as in the case of the Lamanites and other portions of the house of Israel; but by‑and‑by they will become a white and delightsome people. Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses 7:336

&gt;You see some classes of the human family that are black, uncouth, un‑comely, disagreeable and low in their habits, wild, and seemingly deprived of nearly all the blessings of the intelligence that is generally bestowed upon mankind.
Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses 7:290

Of course you will, because it was never motivated by facts or evidence to begin with.

&gt;regardless of your 'feelings' that guns aren't a complicated and more dangerous object

It isn't feelings. They are small relatively simple mechanical objects that require that they be loaded, pointed at someone, and have pressure applied to the trigger to even injure someone let alone kill them.

As opposed to cars and planes which are multiton vehicles that move at high speeds and if their operators have lapses in judgement, become impaired, or are distracted can result in large amount of damager, injuries or even deaths. Which is one of the primary reasons for the disparity in injury and fatality rates from accidents for guns and cars. 

&gt; I still think that their ability to take human life means that they should require training in their use.

And you are wrong, because they fall well below other mundane objects or activities like swimming. If I don't need a license for swimming or riding a bicycle I sure as shit don't need one for a gun. 

&gt;You still 'teach' your kids how to ride that pedal bike.

No I don't. And I certainly don't need to take a test or get a license. 

&gt;So now I have actual information that backs up ""our"" conclusion that Trump is correct. I still think he's still an ass and pandering.

I don't care about Trump. I care about when people start advocating for shite policy just because they *feel* it is a good idea. There is no need for it and all you have is that you believe it would be prudent which isn't a compelling reason for large scale policy.

&gt;Hopefully this information could be used to discuss with Bernie why his vote on the Assault Weapons Ban was wrong, at least he's willing to discuss

The key word here is disproportionality. Not recognizing this does a great disservice to the problem of crime in black communities.

The obvious answer is that they do work on those things, but it is **incredibly** hard to find new vaccines/antibiotics/cures. The reason that so many companies have moved away from things like antibiotics is because the failure rate is so high, even higher than that for treating other diseases. The academic researcher that found a cure for something like diabetes would be famous for the rest of time, probably win a Nobel and their career would explode. There are *absolutely* people working on these things, and there are many many smaller biotech companies that are doing it as well.

As for cures, they absolutely are looking to find new cures for things as well. Look at Sovaldi, or maybe even Gleevac. Those have been monumental discoveries. So, this urban legend that big pharma companies only ever look for symptomatic drugs so that they can keep people sick and profits rolling in is absolutely bogus.

Isn't 25% down to 5% an absolutely great recovery?  And please note that a great deal of  recovery was actually achieved in 4 years before we had a recalcitrant Congress.

It seems to me that recalcitrance is the real problem that our country has faced during recovery periods.  Right now, we have recovered 1/5 of middle class jobs that were lost during the Bush administration.

He could run it as ""sticking to his guns"" in the face of The Washington Establishment™ and holding true to his Core Conservative Values™. Cruz's base would eat it up with a spoon, and it gives him a solid leadership moment as he managed to rally together a group against The Washington Establishment™ and the entire Federal Government. For it or against it, it's a clear sign of power. He could also use the moment to take a few good swipes at the Democrats for ""stupid"" shutdowns, like the Park Service and DC monuments, shutting down websites, and stuff like that.

In a race where everyone is trying to out-conservative each other this could hurt Trump, [who thought the shutdown was ""disgusting.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfJkf-7ITRk), and now [says he would shut down the government over Planned Parenthood](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/250159-trump-shut-down-government-over-planned-parenthood). It doesn't really buy him anything, it could lose him stuff, and it would hand ammo to his strongest competition.

It would also hurt Rubio, [who was a part of the bloc of Senators that rejected the budget under Cruz's leadership](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00209). For him it would be a ""following, not leading"" moment, and following his competitor no less. I can picture the political cartoons now: ""Little"" Rubio following Ted Cruz, trying to be like him, like a son trying to be like his father. It wouldn't have helped [Christie either, who was also against the shutdown](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/chris-christie-against-government-shutdown-097433).

Then there's Kasich, who [never really came out for or against the shut down, but was taking heat for it anyway](http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/09/gov_john_kasich_talks_governme.html). That could weaken him, making him look wishy-washy, or unwilling to hold fast to his values in the face of an upcoming election, pandering.

[While the GOP was super pissed at Cruz over the shutdown](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/ted-cruz-blasted-by-angry-gop-colleagues-government-shutdown-097753), they wouldn't want to hurt Rubio or Kasich, who seemed like the Establishment candidate at varying points. They wouldn't want to piss off any Establishment voters and convince them to scurry somewhere else in the fight for their lives against Trump and Cruz. Not only that, but they want to put that whole chapter as far behind them as possible. The inability to control Cruz makes them look weak and scared, and it would remind voters that the shutdown was their fault, which weakens the party in the general election.

The 2013 Government Shutdown was a firebomb for the GOP, with unpredictable results, and I think they're quite glad it never came up, and with Cruz out of the picture it's no longer a campaign issue because Trump can come out as saying he was always against the shutdown (and be telling the truth, too).",1463533462,24,politics,2016-05,0.14256015

Not to mention the costs to the city for defending the valuation. A property expert alone cost the town $25,000 at the last hearing, according to assessor Fernando Gonzalez.That means tens of thousands of dollars in lost tax revenue, plus thousands of dollars in costs even if the town ends up being right.


&gt; But even in a case where a local municipality wins, it still has to go through a lengthy process. The Palm Beach County property appraiser’s office spends nearly half the year tied up in disputes, but Vince McClaren says only about 10%-to-15% of the over 120 golf courses in the county file these disputes, adding it’s usually the same ones every year.

&gt; It costs just $15 to file a petition by the petitioner, but ties up staff for weeks at a time, and costs the county to hold hearings in front of magistrates.

&gt; What’s more, while other developers seek to lower their tax bills, experts say the vast ocean of difference between Trump’s public disclosure of the properties’ worth vs. what he says the value is when seeking relief on local taxes—and how hard he fights for that relief—seems to be considerably larger than is typical in real estate circles.

Voting for President isn't a simple matter of voting ""for"" someone or ""against"" someone else. It is making a considered, relative decision based on the available options. You cannot vote *for* a major party candidate without considering who you are voting against, and you cannot vote *against* a major party candidate without considering who you are voting for.

If you *are* voting one way or the other irrespective of the practical result (as it sounds you are), then yes, you are making a childish decision.

d76azzx,t1_d75fk2y,t3_50n3ez,dissonance07,"MidAmerican is in a marketplace.  Their neighbors (Alliant in Iowa, Xcel in Minnesota, Ameren and ComEd in Illinois, the actual marketplace spans like 13 states) bid units into the market all the time.  If MidAmerican is short one hour, they will buy energy out of the market from one of their neighbors.  If they are long, they can sell dirt cheap energy into the market for one of their neighbors to buy.

On net, their plan is to produce as much energy in a year with wind as is consumed by their customers.

What this means, on a system level, is difficult to sus out, but if they're buying, they're probably buying from a marginal unit, and the marginal units are more often than not natural gas (coal units, if they can run, are usually run baseload, and would be running no matter what).  Natural gas units can ramp up and down fairly quickly, and natural gas has a lower CO2e than coal.  Hell, they've got a bunch of coal and gas units that they have no intent of retiring.  They'll probably keep using those units for a long time.  Just act as a net exporter.  Iowa utilities have net exported electrical energy for a long time.

EDIT: If you're interested to see how they plan to use their resources (and can parse industry and regulatory jargon), [here](https://efs.iowa.gov/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dID=1539838&amp;allowInterrupt=1) is a testimony from their ratemaking docket ([RPU-2016-0001](https://efs.iowa.gov/efs/ShowDocketSummary.do?docketNumber=WRU-2016-0020-0156), [start here](https://efs.iowa.gov/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dID=1539817&amp;allowInterrupt=1)) which describes it.  Though not stated plainly, the intent is to produce with wind as many kWh in a year as are used by their customers.  They have no intent to retire their fossil generation, and intend to operate it as needed to meet daily needs, or buy energy off of the MISO market.  They simply operate as a net exporter of energy.  {That being the case, on the whole, members of the MISO market will be using more wind and less of other things. In the MISO market, there will be like 20GW of wind, out of like 140+GW of total generation.}  Also, technically, with this investment, they estimate they will reach only 85% coverage of customer use, but they repeatedly stated their 100% goal.

The ruling itself is just an allowance to install 2000MW of wind and spend $3.58B.  The hearing and investments were timed, specifically, to take advantage of the federal Production Tax Credit (PTC) which subsidizes new wind plants for $23/MWh for the first 10 years of the plant (must be operational before the 12/31/2019 expiration date).  Other testimony states that they are not requesting a rate increase (presumably because the free MWh and PTC$s offset the cost of the debt used to pay for investments).",1472785189,1,politics,2016-09,0.08637348

Since Clinton had everything on her own server she also was responsible for the security of the material.

Hillary's top security guy told her he thinks they are being hacked, said he can't stop or trace the hack and asked to bring the State Department in to help him.  Hillary, in an act of self-preservation not wanting anyone at the state department to know she had a private server, told her guy to just unplug the server from the wall and don't tell anyone.  How she handled that tells you everything you need to know.  She was so concerned with keeping her server secret that she'd rather let her emails be hacked than report it to the state department.

Trump won because a lot of people have extremely racist and classist world views. Trump realized immigration was a hot button issue and made that the core of his campaign, despite facts that show immigration is far from the issue he claims it is. Xenophobia and nationalism won Trump this election. 

Unfortunately, that's not something the Democrats can counter. The only way we win in the future is if Trump is a spectacular economic failure, which is not good for anyone.

ddotfg1,t1_ddo0ji1,t3_5to0ye,slanaiya,"That didn't stop a majority of Republicans approving of Clinton in 2012.  Her overall approval among Americans was in the high 60s% when she left her role as Secretary of State to campaign for the presidency and a majority of Republicans approved of her at that time.

In reality, even among Republicans she has held solid ratings more often than not during her public life.

One of the biggest lies this election is that Clinton was some immensely unpopular candidate.  Even a majority of Republicans approved of her as recently as 2012.  Think about that.  A majority of Republicans approved of her and among all Americans, more than two thirds approved of her when she left her previous role to get ready to campaign.

Falling for this lie is part of the problem.  It's not a small lie, it's a whopper yet belief in it is pervasive.  Clinton has rarely been particularly unpopular with the general population or even with Republicans.  2012 was like barely more than 4 years ago, and less than 4 years before this lie was propagated.

I think, on some level, you have to do A.  You have to talk with them, and make them realize that they're not actually accomplishing anything.  Ideally in as non-accusatory way as possible, but still.  This is a thing they need to realize.

I sympathize with them, and I agree that having more than 2 political parties is where we want to be.  But unfortunately, I don't think voting third party is a realistic way to accomplish it.

Tarring all of ANTIFA and BLM as ""bigoted hate groups"" because some of their members have been violent is as silly as tarring Christianity as a hate group because some Christians shoot abortion doctors. 

ANTIFA has been around for decades and is a worldwide group. Some members participate in unnecessary violence, physically attacking their opponents without provocation, and that's obviously wrong. But some of the violent clashes with literal Nazis have been somewhat necessary, unless you think that violent Nazis should be allowed to walk the streets with weapons chanting antisemitic propaganda unopposed. The foundational idea of ANTIFA is simply that they're against fascism. Even if I disagree with the tactics some of them have used, I don't think the whole movement can be accurately labelled ""a bigoted hate group"" the same way that Nazis and the KKK are. Similar things can be said for BLM. 

If you really think the Nazis, the KKK, ANITFA and BLM ""are all ideologies birthed by democrats"" then you're just obviously wrong. I don't know what else to say.",1503351010,1,politics,2017-08,0.34328604

My concern with that mostly stems from concern over how filled in it needs to be to count, and moreso, to what extent a stray mark or offset bubble will result in the vote not being counted.

In a punch card, you marked your vote by punching a hole in the perforated card, so it was easy to tell if the hole was there or not (the small piece of the card would come off) and then in either case, they're ran through a machine that does the actual counting.

Such a ridiculous argument. If you double the population, you don't have to double the bureaucracy. A large population should be *easier* to manage. Especially when you consider the way elections in the US work, where the presidential election isn't managed at a Federal level and is all done by the states themselves. At least argue population density.

Population density in Germany is about the same as Maryland. ",1513608032,2,politics,2017-12,0.33504707

If supporting a nice lifestyle is valuable to you then I would recommend you find a new profession. Unfortunately everyone isn't cut out to make a living in the art world. If you love doing it keep at it, but you may be better off finding work somewhere else. 

You are very hard working, even if you just earned minimum wage you'd be in the 1%. The likelihood that you end up stuck earning minimum wage if you work that hard is 0%. 

I think of myself as an artist of sorts, but I'm not talented or well connected enough to make a living as such. I work in industrial sales during the week days and spend my evenings and weekends doing what I love. I'll make close to six figures this year, I find comfort in the lifestyle my work affords me - I've taken up woodworking over the past few months, it's an expensive hobby, but I enjoy making things. The less than ideal employment is a sacrifice I'm perfectly willing to make in order to fulfill my life in other meaningful ways. 

If you want to continue working as an artist go ahead, if you can only ever earn $3 an hour then that's all your work is worth. Don't be resentful of people who have different aptitudes or different priorities. Don't expect others to support your dreams at the cost of theirs - you aren't that special.

You forget that the cities cannot rely on the labor of people in say, Appalachia. Who else will farm our fields? Who else will do the jobs that no wants? They come here seeking a new life. A guatemalan escaping the cartels. A venezuelan escaping a hopelessly corrupt, authoritarian regime. Many are good people who simply cannot wait for visa applications. Many are poor, many are in danger. We do not send them to towns to take others' jobs. We take them into our cities, protect them, treat them like any other citizen or resident. Ironically, the worst thing we inflict on these people is eagerly take advantage of them to do the jobs no one else will. We fight not just for the rights of the migrant worker, but for the rights of everyone. You have the right to maternity leave, to reasonable paid vacation, to job security, to healthcare. We do not care if you have visa or not, if you are a contributing member of the community, and pose no threat, we protect you. We give you work, care, housing. Of course there are criminals. Of course people take advantage of our generosity. And they are met with the swift and dutiful hand of the law.

We have fought for immigration reform, for economic reform. Because in the end, the cities can handle this. It is the smaller towns that suffer, stuck in a limbo between being to large for small town economics but too small for city economics.
That is why we afford protection. We would very much like to help the flyover states,seeing as we already bankroll them. But, they govern themselves. We fight for their rights too, their benefits. If they do not want them, that is their business. But  you cannot in good conscience tell us, who are more than capable of affording these rights and protections to those who deserve them, that we must deny these to some, but not others.

They cannot hide forever, but we fight tooth and nail to repair what we see as morally corrupt immigration system, so that they don't have to hide. That is why we help immigrants. Because they are no different to you or I.",1517290670,2,politics,2018-01,0.20126031

Again, please show me where they mentioned Trump. You do realize American politics involves other people as well, quite a few actually. The things they talked about are endemic to American politics at the moment.

The fact you think Trump has a monopoly on bombastic rhetoric, insult, phony controversies, and manufactured outrage is pretty telling to be honest.

Yeah, I appreciate that you dislike McCain. I'm not too crazy about him myself. But I don't see how that's particularly relevant here. It sounds like you just want to shoehorn in an insult about McCain. Be my guest. I don't have a dog in that fight.

This last part is simply dedicated to this insanely ignorant statement,

&gt; You just inherently don't get the flexibility, freedom, and innovation in socialism - market or otherwise - as is available in capitalism.

This is exactly the opposite. Unlike what your common knowledge might dictate.

First of all the modern innovation which you see, in the capitalist west or anywhere else. In most part has been developed by the state, in the state sector, by public funding and public subsidies.

By and large following the principal of subsidise cost through the public and privatise the profits. Radically different from anything capitalist.

So big tech companies leech of the innovations like the Internet, Li-Ion technology, GPS, Touch Screen, Artificial Intelligence( speech recognition to expert system), computer hardware like RAM and rom development all took place in publicly funded research institutions like University campuses and national research labs. The mathematics required for this or software systems required for this or the understanding of physics or chemistry required for this were worked out in the university campuses in the US or other countries, by public funding of the research activities. And since all of these are open source, it is easily exploited by people with capital to make more money. The big tech company spend less than 5% of the revenue in R&amp;D.

Here take the [iphone](https://marianamazzucato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/iphone-slide.jpeg) for instance. This chart is from this [book](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/The_Entrepreneurial_State.html?id=Wro1DgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false). Which actually puts the whole capitalist innovation into perspective.

And again this is just not big tech. In pharmaceuticals nearly all of the new drugs released every year is funded by the NIH through public money, the research takes place in campuses funded by the NIH or the federal government or state government.

When you take a look at the money invested or funding given. As this [study](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1001/jama.2014.15939) does. The NIH itself funds greater than 50% of all basic research which is directed to pharmaceutical drugs, federal state and university grants, form the large remaining chunks.

However it is during the stage 3 clinical trials when the private capital flows in. And this is when the patents are given out. Thus allowing the drug companies to have the patents and charge exorbitant prices, which the American people pay twice for, but the drug companies do not pay for the high risk basic research phase, which is done by the NIH and NSF. [This](https://other98-c91a.kxcdn.com/app/uploads/2018/03/image1.png) is how pharmaceutical companies spend their money.

Take travel or tourism one of the most dynamic part of the economy. It is entirely based on air transport. The modern air transport was entirely developed by public subsidies to Boeing and other military contractors. Or in university aerospace or aerodynamic departments. Their funding came from the DOD.

And this goes on and on, every single dynamic sector of the economy is brought out by public spending and research through co-operation, while the profits is privatised. This goes on from green renewables to nuclear technology.

&gt; market or otherwise - as is available in capitalism.

Now forget all of that insane violation of market principals. And take a look at the innovation which comes from the market itself. 

Economists fully agree that monopolies innovate better than competition. This is the Schumpeterian view of innovation and is called creative destruction, and is also the mainstream view. Then there is Scherers work which gives a theoretical limit to innovation in a competitive market scenario.

Now if you are not satisfied with the theory then look at the empirical studies done. Again they overwhelmingly conclude that monopolies innovate better than competition. Take a look at the studies of AT&amp;T when they were a monopoly, which culminated in the creation of the transistor, in Bell Labs. Note the co-operative character of Bell Labs. Or take a look at the studies comparing Intel and AMD in developing CPU's which find that Intel would create more innovations without the presence of competition from AMD.

http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/now/question/216743-is-competition-or-monopoly-more-innovative

https://hbr.org/2005/12/no-monopoly-on-innovation

Worst part about it is business people know this and take advantage of it. While the general public keeps believing that innovation is taking place because of capitalistic competition. While in actuality it is neither competition nor capitalism, but co-operation and monopolies.

If you ask a scientist about his work he will enthusiastically talk to you about it, not hide it within patents. All scientific work is build upon others like, ""standing in the shoulder of giants"".",1546122798,1,politics,2018-12,0.35186127

If you bring up charges of corruption, we already know that, no matter what, no Republican voter will hold it against any Republican official for voting against impeachment. You could have verified video of Donald Trump personally writing himself a ten million dollar check from the US Treasury, and **not one Republican** would change their vote. A corrupt President is the *goal* of the Republican party, so long as the corrupt President is also a Republican.

Even if there was incontrovertible proof of corruption and treason, no Republican official would vote to impeach. More to the point, no Republican official would be the least bit ashamed of not voting to impeach. You couldn't use it against them because no Republican voter would care. Even more to the point, these *exact same Republican officials* would vote for impeachment of any Democrat President no matter how trivial the charges.

The problem is the Republican party sees one issue as being paramount: that the Republican party holds power. They believe this, alone, is what is good for America. Public policy doesn't matter. The budget deficit clearly doesn't matter. Rule of law doesn't matter. There's only ONE thing that is good for America, and that is that the Republican party holds power, no matter what. Let everything else burn to the ground as long as this one goal is achieved.

So, we are better off just letting Trump be Trump and let him continue to demonstrate the level of corruption that the Republican party will enable. There will be lots of previously Republicans who will leave the party and, hopefully, there will be enough to give other parties the majority.

Of course, at that point, the remaining Republican's become dangerous because they won't abandon their one, paramount point. They'll abandon democracy first.",1568147129,-3,politics,2019-09,0.3281604

f9w0ib1,t1_f9vyseg,t3_e710oj,MaNewt,"Medicare is funded primarily by general taxes and payroll taxes, and only funded 15% by premiums https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/the-facts-on-medicare-spending-and-financing/
Ie, it is funded by people not on Medicare. Adding more people of the same population to Medicare does not strengthen it. Adding healthy and young people without prexisting conditions strengthens it. This is why other socialized medicine systems like the UK work (that and single payer gives them better bargaining power on costs). 


The reason why non sick people will may choose not Medicare has nothing to do with the coverage being bad, it will be because the price private insurance companies can offer them is less. The business model becomes: determine who is likely to make a claim, and deny them, and take low risk money from everyone else at rates lower than Medicare. Until you are higher risk, it is cheaper for you to buy private insurance, and that money goes to the private insurance companies and not the public option funds. Then when you are higher risk, private insurance companies raise your rates or outright drop you because they are unlikely to make money off you, and you turn to Medicare. 

Insurance pools are strengthened by adding people who pay in more than they take out. Insurance companies entire business is determining how much money a population is likely to take out. They can compete for these healthy&amp;wealthy people by simply offering insurance to everyone at $5/month less than Medicare who are unlikely to ever file claims, and drop them shorty after they get sick (within legal limits), since they don’t have a mandate to insure everyone based on means like Medicare does.

At its core Medicare for all has two potential advantages:

* A single payer has huge leverage in negotiating drug and treatment prices

* A single pool containing statistically healthy populations will require less tax revenue to support because the healthy put in more than they take out. 

Medicare for all who want it dramatically weaken both advantages by removing bargaining power With hospitals and drug companies from Medicare, and dramatically weaken the healthy pool who are needed to pay for the sick. It sounds like the best of both worlds, but the compromise means it is structurally unsound.",1575684710,3,politics,2019-12,0.028031485

fdrcdvq,t1_fdra6wf,t3_emppun,GilesDMT,"See, that’s precisely why made it a point to say “possible.”  I do not know, and I do not have evidence.  But my link below explains in simple detail how that’s a logical conclusion with what information we do actually have. 

The dilated pupils has been a point made about possible pseudoephedrine use, and the taco bowl picture shows a drawer full of Sudafed.  I can’t think of many reasons a person would have a literal drawer of drugs, OTC or otherwise.  Particularly a seemingly healthy individual, and particularly that much of only one drug. 

There is a Dr. Brown (who at least claims to possess the expertise of an opthamologist) that goes into detail about the pupil dilation and how this may be an indicator of Sudafed abuse.  I’d love someone who is a confirmed expert in the field corroborate the info he provides, but until then, here’s that information:

https://www.politicalflare.com/2019/08/trumps-pupils-are-often-very-dilated-and-a-doctor-explains-what-this-could-mean/

This behavior is echoed by a comedian who worked with Trump (Noel Casler) on The Apprentice claiming that he “ate UK Sudafed like candy.”

So I’d like to reiterate: I deliberately use the qualifier “possible” because it is just that.  I did not state that this is fact, so please refrain from misrepresenting what I do say.

fwn4v6l,t3_hjmacg,t3_hjmacg,tethercat,"Q Vice President Pence, a question: A lot of people here praising each other at the job — particularly the job the Governor has done and Dr. Cara Christ is done. But you were briefed. You know that we’re breaking records on new number of cases, numbers of deaths. And it was just pointed out plans were implemented where doctors who may soon have to decide who lives, who dies, who gets care, who doesn’t.

So from you, why would you fly all the way to Arizona? What does the Governor need to be thanked for and praised for? What have they specifically done that you think they’ve done a good job on?

THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, the rising cases here in Arizona is why I’m here. It’s why we brought the White House Coronavirus Task Force here. I’m a real believer, as President Trump is, in — in sitting down with the people that are leading the effort.

I was in Texas over the weekend, I’ll be in Florida tomorrow because we’re absolutely determined to make sure that Arizona and those healthcare workers have the resources, the supplies, and the equipment they need to render the care that any one of us would want a member of the family to have.

And I must tell you today, I — I can’t account for the reports that you cite. The reality is that, from the briefing that we received today, hospital capacity remains within manageable lines: 85 percent of hospital beds are spoken for, 88 percent of ICU beds are spoken for. We continue to see cases rising. But as we’ve surveyed hospitals across the state, personal protective equipment — those things that they need to render care — appear to be in abundant supply. But we’re here to make sure that remains to be the case.

We don’t ever want any healthcare professional making a decision about who gets healthcare and who doesn’t. This is America. We’re going to make sure healthcare workers here in Arizona have the equipment, have the supplies, and also have the therapeutic medicines to render care to — to save lives. And that’s our ongoing commitment.",1593648099,3,politics,2020-07,0.09394901

They pivot to a George W Bush style of compassionate outreach to conservative minorities like latinos and older African Americans, they stick to minimal government, and base their policy on what seems to work rather than what sells, and they could rebuild.  But to do that they have to stop caring about abortion, admit where social conservatism is self-defeating (aka when it opposes science) and start advocate responsible policy even if it isn't republican policy.

When Youtube first showed up right wingers prided themselves on skepticism and caution about the PC beliefs.  Under Obama and Trump they drifted to radical nonsense ideas and white supremacy.

Reclaim reason and they have a chance.

I'm sure people said the same thing about the Minoan pantheon, and Atenism, and Catharism. 

Religions die all the time. That's a fact of the world, and most of them seem to be dying significantly faster with the advent of the internet, where people can be exposed to other faith traditions, and cultures, and have access to human understanding to see that that shit their parents taught them, just because their parents parents taught them, has no justification. 

That it's mythological nonsense, evil that holds us all back. 

&gt; I'm not a Muslim but I've travelled widely in more moderate Muslim countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, Morocco. Those countries have hard liners but they're mostly pretty easy going.

Yeah very *moderate* whipping, torturing, and executing, plus jailing people for blasphemy, or not wearing a Hijab, and those are just punishments enforced by the State apparatus, say nothing of the actual populace. 

Let me know when Malaysian politicians stop calling for Atheists to be hunted down, and start talking about expanding basic human rights to their populace in accordance with the U.N. charter.

Let me know when this is off the Moroccan criminal code which condemns “those who attempt to shake the faith of a Muslim” to up to 3 years in jail.

&gt; They're also by far the majority of Muslims, Indonesia has 229 million of them. Only 20% of Muslims are in Arab countries.

Yeah such a wonderful place where people are routinely killed for being an Atheist, and you both have your Religious association on your identification cards, and where it's a logistical nightmare to try to get that status changed, and you face routine discrimination from all facets of society. 


I say this to you because you seemingly don't understand it: You are a tourist in those nations. You don't have to live there, and as a tourist you aren't going to see, nor feel the social, or probably legal, ramifications of your status. 


You pretending like any of those three nations even **remotely** moderate is disingenuous as best. 

&gt; This is the vast majority of muslims, just like Christians that ignore the fact they should stone their daughter to death if caught for adultery are the vast majority of Christians.

As I said, you are wrong. 

https://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/


The Pew Research center is credible, and the statistics completely disagree with. While it's true most Muslims cherry pick, literally anyone who is Religious *has* to engage in cherry picking in order to survive the cognitive dissonance because their Religion is abhorrent, and internally inconsistent, most Muslims **are not** proponents of secular morality.

&gt; Now, new government data show that audits of the super-rich and large corporations have hit a new low, leaving billions of dollars of uncollected taxes at precisely a moment when lawmakers say new revenue is needed to fund infrastructure and climate investments.

&gt; The sharp reduction in audits of the rich contributes to the tax gap between the amount of taxes owed and paid.

&gt; &amp;quot;After years of Republican budget cuts and skewed priorities, the IRS now audits those who make $20,000 at about the same rate as the top 1 percent, even though the vast majority of unpaid taxes are attributable to wealthy tax cheats,&amp;quot; said Frank Clemente of Americans for Tax Fairness, which advocates for higher taxes on the wealthy.

gt9gg3q,t1_gt9e6lg,t3_mj98gm,19GOrwell84,"Unfortunately the anti-Georgia voting law proponents, cannot provide you facts to support their claim of the law being racist and denying minorities access to voting.  Read the law.  According to Georgia Public Broadcasting analysis of the election law:  

Georgia passed a series of new voting laws aimed to curb alleged voter fraud and myths about voter disenfranchisement and discrimination are running rampant.

“The Election Integrity Act of 2021” expands in-person early voting dates and hours for most counties, according to Georgia Public Broadcasting. The original drafts of the legislation would have scrapped all weekend voting aside from the second Saturday, but changes were made to now allow both Saturdays of the early voting period to hold voting and gives counties the options to hold voting on Sundays, according to Georgia Public Broadcasting.

The legislation also requires three weeks of early voting and expands the hours the polls are open. The changes were made in response to opposition from racial justice groups who said the proposal targeted black voters who traditionally participate in “Souls to the Polls” voter drives that take place on Sunday’s, according to NPR.

Myth: Voters Won’t Have Access To Water While They Wait In Line

One of the provisions bans volunteers from handing out food, water or other items to voters standing in line. Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia Andrea Young criticized the law, including this specific provision.

“Senate Bill 202 is an anti-voter bill that attacks absentee voting, criminalizes giving Georgians a drink of water to their neighbors, allows state takeover of county elections, and retaliates against the elected Secretary of State by replacing him with a State Board of Elections Chair chosen by the legislature – not the voters.”

President Joe Biden also criticized the provision, according to The Hill.

“If you want any indication that it has nothing to do with fairness, nothing to do with decency, they passed a law saying you can’t provide water to people standing in line while they’re waiting to vote?” Biden reportedly said.


“You don’t need anything else to know that this is nothing but punitive, designed to keep people from voting. You can’t provide water for people about to vote. Give me a break.”

Fact: Voters Will Still Have Access To Water &amp; Are Not Forbidden From Bringing Their Own Food Items

“No person shall solicit votes in any manner or by any means or method, nor shall any person distribute or display any campaign material, nor shall any person give, offer to give, or participate in the giving of any money or gifts, including, but not limited to, food and drink, to an elector,” the law reads.

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said in December that the state would crack down on “line warming” which includes giving voters gifts of any kind to “inappropriately influence voters in the crucial final moments before they cast their ballots.”

The law, however, still allows voters to have access to water, despite claims to the contrary.

“This Code section shall not be construed to prohibit a poll officer from distributing… or from 1828 making available self-service water from an unattended receptacle to an elector waiting in 1829 line to vote.”

Myth: The Election Laws Facilitate “Voter Suppression”

Another provision Democrats are criticizing is the provision requiring voters show an ID to get an absentee ballot.

An op-ed written by Teri Kanefield calls the new law “Jim Crow.”

Kanefield acknowledges the law expands voter access but then says requiring voters to show an ID presents “unnecessary hurdles.”

Biden also criticized this provision, saying these were “rigid restrictions.”

Fact: Voter ID Laws Are Found In More Than Half Of U.S. States

Residents can receive a free ID Card from the state at any county registrar’s office with proper proof of residency and other documentation.

Out of Georgia’s near 11 million population, approximately 200,000 Georgian’s lack a drivers license or state identification card, according to CNN. That is less than 2% of the state’s population. AJC reports 97% of registered Georgia voters have an official driver’s license or state ID.

For the some 200,000 residents who don’t have identification, Georgia residents can receive a Georgia ID card which has no age restriction. Applicants have to fill out the required forms to receive an ID. Applicants must also provide proof of residency, their social security number and proof of citizenship. Utility bills, phone bills and a birth certificate are just some of the ways residents can prove they are Georgia residents.

Voters will be required to request and return an absentee ballot with an ID, be it either a driver’s license or state ID number. Voters can also verify their ballot with the last four digits of their social security number. Votes can be returned online through an online request portal so long as a voter has their driver’s license number or state ID number, according to Georgia Public Broadcasting.

Voter identification laws are not uncommon and at least 35 states require voters to show or present some form of ID when voting, whether it be by mail or in person. Georgia already has voter ID laws in place for in person voting.

Myth: The New Law “Ends Voting Hours Early”

Biden claimed he was “worried” about how “un-American this whole initiative is.”

“It’s sick. It’s sick. Deciding that you’re going to end voting at five o’clock when working people are just getting off work.”

Biden reiterated a similar sentiment in a written statement the following day.

“Among the outrageous parts of this new state law, it ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over.”

Fact: Voting Access Has Not Been Reduced

The Washington Post gave Biden’s claims a whopping four Pinocchios.

“One could understand a flub in a news conference. But then this same claim popped up in an official presidential statement,” Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler wrote. “Not a single expert we consulted who has studied the law understood why Biden made this claim, as this was the section of the law that expanded voting for many Georgians.”

The new voting law still permits polling places to be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and as long as you are in line by 7 p.m. then you can still vote, the Post confirmed.

“You can criticize the bill for many things, but I don’t think you can criticize it for reducing the hours you can vote,” University of Georgia political scientist Charles S. Bullock III said, according to the report. Bullock suspected Biden was briefed on an early draft of the version and was not updated on the final version.

Early voting access would be expanded for most counties and would add an additional mandatory Saturday, Georgia Public Broadcasting said. Counties can also have early voting open as early as 7 a.m. and as late as 7 p.m., according to Georgia Public Broadcasting.

The Post surmises Biden may have erred because the old law said “voting shall be conducted during normal business hours,” according to the Post. The new version specifically says “beginning at 9:00 a.m. and ending at 5:00 p.m.”

An election official said the formal change was made because some rural county election offices operated on a part-time basis rather than a standard 8-hour day, so the language just specified the hours, according to the report.",1617470148,-9,politics,2021-04,0.16158698

You are admitting that he was on the edge. You understand why it's neccessary with this kind of individual to keep them under control? Or should law inforcement just wait for it to happen sooner or later? This is a great tactic on prevention, instead of waiting for it to happen who knows when you control when it's going to happen.

h22aacg,t1_h1zh9xd,t3_o140g8,variaati0,"Nope. The problem is the two party system. Since there is no realistic practical serious challengers, the whole what argument people listen to or get convinced is actually kinda moot.

Also with more proportional system, you wouldn't have 3rd party. You would have 3rd, 4th and 5th. If one would go by the pretty standard trends of international precedence. Both Republican and Democratic parties would immediately split. Only thing keeping them together is the forcing of FPTP voting method aka the two party system. Both the *feel the Bern people* and *Tea partiers* would have split/ caused a split, if anyone had a choice in the matter. 

At such there would be 4 parties as result of that ""hardcore"" right wing and left wing parties and centre left and centre right. On top of that one would almost certainly get a ""moderate"" centre party. That is how it usually shakes out. Plus minor more specific issue parties on top.

This would mean...... *everyone* would have to up their campaign game and everyone would be damn more incentivised to do more specific and informed campaigning.

Since the choice isn't any more ""us vs them. With us or with the despicable otherside"". On both major wings one would have to explain.... ""why us and not our moderate/radical sister party"".

USA has horrible campaigning, since the lack of competition allows it. Why bother with nuanced campaigning, when one can always pull the ""vote for us or the party of semi devil's at the other end of the spectrum might win."" Plus actually there is kinda understanding between RNC and DNC about ""don't raise question about certain things like the fairness of the election method, because the method always ensures either of us is always at worst on silver medal"".

Gerry mandering...... would not be issue to begin with in multiseat district proportional elections. Well why don't either party raise it as obvious solution to the problem of ""the despicable otherside gerrymanders"" and instead fiddle around with naughty naughty shouldn't Gerry mander, need independent commission.

Because more afraid than othersides Gerrymandering..... they fear the other obvious end result of multiseat proportional elections...... It would break the two party system and then not only could they lose and end up at silver. They might end up at bronze or even worse at points places.

Thus the election method not only affects the direct election results, but whole political culture, political parlance and even the level of citizens information about the political world. Since it is way more involved process to choose 1 from 6 options, rather than 1 from 2. It makes easy choices harder with couple close to, but not exactly same messages being put out by campaigns. 

This incentivising looking for more information. Just out of *Well do I vote for the moderate GOP splinter or the radical GOP splinter. We have always been a GOP voting family, but now there is two of them. Getting complicated, which of these is closer to the original GOP I always used to vote for.

ha54a1w,t1_ha4ddlv,t3_p9xvvy,hagy,"I think some Democrats want to preserve the filibuster because it has been useful to us before and may be useful to us again should we lose the Senate majority. This [June 2020 Politico article](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/08/senate-record-breaking-gridlocktrump-303811) quantifies this by showing how it was used 314 times throughout the Trump administration (and that is only up to June 2020). Whereas during the 8 years of the Obama administration, the filibuster was used less frequently with a total of 175 uses.

A [Jan 2021 WaPo article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/01/26/democrats-have-vigorously-used-filibuster-its-pathetic-they-now-wont-pledge-protect-it/) explains some of the major uses of the filibuster by democrats during the republican majority senate of the Trump presidency.

&gt; When Schumer was minority leader, he vigorously used the filibuster to do just that. Under his leadership, Democrats used the filibuster to block funding for construction of Trump’s border wall in 2019. They used it not once, but twice to impede passage of the Cares Act — forcing Republicans to agree to changes including a $600 weekly federal unemployment supplement. They used it in September and October to stop Republicans from passing further coronavirus relief before the November election. They used it to halt Sen. Tim Scott’s (R-S.C.) police reform legislation so Republicans could not claim credit for forging a bipartisan response to the concerns of racial justice protesters. They used it to block legislation to force “sanctuary cities” to cooperate with federal officials, and to stop a prohibition on taxpayer funding of abortion, bans on abortions once the unborn child is capable of feeling pain, and protections for the lives of babies born alive after botched abortions.",1629797163,1,politics,2021-08,0.04315203

hmgpvy0,t1_hmgjjwv,t3_r4cx4x,merrickgarland2016,"Barack Obama was definitely not very progressive. (Incredibly, Hillary Clinton may have been more so and that's not saying much.) Whoever won that primary was pretty much a shoe-in because Republicans were widely despised at that moment. IOW, centrist or progressive would have won. In that sense, it would have been a good time to run someone more progressive.

Despite Obama's weak appetite for progress, the real limit to change was in the Congress which was loaded with nearly 60 'blue dogs,' and the Senate with Mr. Ultimate Shill Joe Lieberman. So in 2010, people stayed home, half of blue dogs were wiped out, and Republicans took back the House to institute a *policy* of total obstruction. In his defense, Obama held the line unlike Bill Clinton who collapsed to pretty much the entire Republican agenda except for bringing back the Iraq war.

We should have stayed the painfully slow course in 2010. A third election win in a row would have emboldened Democrats to do more. This is about where we are now. We have to stay the course now. 

We can look at the 2006, 2008, and 2010 elections and compare them to 2018, 2020, and 2022. First thing we see is that in 2018 and 2020, turnout for Democrats was much larger than 2006 and 2008--record-breaking turnout both times. But unlike then, this time they didn't get the decent majorities because Republican turnout was also at record highs. On the other hand, Joe Biden is definitely more progressive than Barack Obama was (which has been a nice surprise).

So we have a much more progressive Democratic Party now, but a super slim majority and a few spoilers. We can also expect higher Republican turnout in 2022.

The Democrats have endless factions that love to boycott and attack/undermine one another over just about any grievance. 

Meanwhile, the GOP seems to agree 100% on a few key issues and is willing to fall in line and show up to vote for anyone the party says to vote for regardless of how crazy or extreme they are if it means advancing those few narrow goals. The traditional GOP economic conservatives hold their nose and vote for the crazy religious extremists or white nationalist types if it means another vote for their ""small government""/low taxes agenda.

Trump being voted for President in 2016 was democracy, and so was Biden winning the 2020 election.

He knew what kind of vile man Thomas was when he nominated him, it wasn’t much a secret back then either. Bush found a guy who fit his criteria to the letter, except he was uncharacteristically unqualified. Like ACB unqualified. 

He knew nominating Thomas would put the Democrats in a very difficult position. They could vote against his nomination and be slandered as a racist, or vote for him knowing he wasn’t qualified. 

Anita Hill should have been the godsend that she was. All the Democrats had to do was actually believe her. Our country didn’t learn from Anita Hill and we were forced to repeat it with Beer-boofing-brett.

iwqow0q,t1_iwqieef,t3_yxu9sr,NeoRyu777,"Do you think it might be a ""guilt by association"" thing? Like, there are a bunch of stereotypes about rural areas being ""out of touch"" with how things work in the city and vice versa. I have no idea how true those stereotypes are (I'm a military brat, so I've been in urban areas my whole life), but the logic chain seems pretty clear, though obviously incomplete and flawed if you actually think about it. 

Rural areas tend to put Republicans in office. Republicans, especially in the last few decades, have had a... very divisive outlook in politics, with a very ""us against them"" game plan that vilifies Democrats. The Republicans keep getting elected, so obviously they're doing something that the rural areas like. 

So, the logic goes that means that rural areas hate Democrats. So, how do rural Democrats fit? Well, either you fit in (which makes you different from Republicans how, exactly?), or the rural areas hate you too (so why the heck are you still there?), or the community has accepted you (so why on earth do they keep voting obstructionist, racist Republicans into office?). None of it makes sense. 

It's difficult to reconcile, so a lot of people will go for the first thing that makes sense: rural Democrats aren't really the same as the rest of the Democrats. They might be a bit more liberal than the rest of the population, but there's gotta be something different.

Nice. Trying to re-frame my statements. Really shows a lot. I didn't say it was ""given to workers by the government"". I said simply that it ""went to workers"" in response to you stating that ""ZERO dollars of PPP were payed to workers"". I also said beforehand that ""the majority of PPP debt forgiven was money payed to workers"". So you can fuck off with trying to blatantly misinterpret what I said.


>It was given to the owners with the agreement that it would be used for as the owner saw fit.

Incorrect. It was loaned to businesses and forgiven on the condition that a specified portion of that loan was used for payroll. So if their decisions did not include payroll, it was not given to them. If they purposely made false reports on their spending, that would be considered fraud. Which I've already addressed.


>Again, with no oversight.

Less oversight than what they probably should have? Sure I'll agree with that. None whatsoever? Can you at least try to be serious?


>Forgive me for thinking that not all of it was used to keep workers employed

I never asserted that you said that. What you did say is ""ZERO dollars of PPP were payed to workers"". Those are clearly different. No weaseling.


>especially because there are so many examples of owners taking PPP money and laying off a ton of staff anyways

For the companies that had PPP loans forgiven, and laid off workers, then I would say it's very likely they needed those employees if they still had to cut costs despite the loan. It's also likely the layoffs would have been much larger.


>As you said, only a certain amount needed to be used for payroll, past that it is literal free money from the government to business owners.

For the record, the required threshold was 60% of the loan, which was decreased from the original 75%. If your definition of ""free money from the government"" is ""the government provides money if you do certain things"", and you don't like that, then why do you want the government subsidizing post-secondary education?


>Heck, even if it was all used for payroll, that's still the government giving money away to directly benefit the owners by relieving them of upkeep costs.

1. It's usually good for businesses to be stable. Mass company failure is usually not very good for the stability of a country.
2. PPP was intended to mitigate cost-cutting via worker layoffs. So if the alternative to less cost-cutting and less unemployment is, cost-cutting and people more unemployment, I'll pass.


>8% of the loans being out-and-out fraud is a BIG FUCKING DEAL because that is over $60 billion!!! That is literally billions of dollars that the government is acknowledging that they wasted by giving it to literal criminals.

I agree. It is a big deal. And it should be handled appropriately. What I don't agree with is that 8% equates to 100%. A higher than acceptable amount of fraud doesn't mean zero workers benefited from the program.


>And you say that it's recoverable, but... who is actually going out and hunting that money down? There's ~600 prosecutions that have been made for fraudulent loans, but that totals only $600 million. That's only 1% of the total fraudulent money, which again, is in the billions!

Small Business Administration/Office of Inspector General


>And don't try to pretend like student debt isn't a major burden on those who have it. 

Again, you're just making shit up to make yourself feel better. Never said it wasn't a burden. Just not one that should necessitates loan forgiveness.


>College prices have absolutely skyrocketed to exploitative levels

To the contrary, inflation adjusted tuition is the lowest it's been in ten years and has plateaued in the past decade. It's so exploitative, that degree holders not only earn far more than those with lower levels of education, but the vast majority of degrees have an positive ROI. That's even after considering the likelihood to dropout.


>for most people with student debt it is the single greatest source of debt they have - more than credit cards, cars, or rent

Excuse me, what? You got a source on that because I have found nothing that substantiates that? Mortgages absolutely dwarf student loans on just about every scale possible. Mortgages, nationally, account for about seven times the debt student loans do, have payments about six times larger average payments, and 42% of households have mortgages in comparison to about 18% with student loans.


>Interest is still interest no matter how you slice it

Sure, but the point is that it's an incredibly conservative loan with a multitude of options for something that is incredibly valuable.


>forbearance is a trap because your interest still accumulates! It isn't uncommon for some people to have their total debt actually increase over time.

You're right. I should have spoke of deference of subsidized loans. Although the forbearance during COVID did set rates to 0%. I mistakenly use those terms interchangeably. But it is rare for a student loan to grow over time. The only time that occurs if the interest is not paid off at the end of an accrual period and it gets capitalized. On IDPs, the government usually will even cover the remaining interest to prevent this from occurring. Usually this only happens in the case of private loans, or outright negligence.


>And all that, for what? Our society needs people with college degrees to function

I agree, which is why I'm glad we have things like grants, scholarships, and student loans to make it accessible to those that want to pursue post-secondary education.


>Do we really want a country where becoming a nurse, teacher, or engineer is restricted to who is wealthy enough to survive the trials of student debt?

The issue is you're conflating all degrees as inherently necessary and that they should be treated with equal value. They're simply not. I think the people who are willing and able to pursue a specific field should generally assume the costs and risks associated with that pursuit. That way, market forces can approximate a cost that accurately represents the value of the education. For the critical jobs that require education, but for some reason don't garner much of wage, we already have numerous consolations to sustain these fields like IPDs, and loan forgiveness. I don't think it's a good idea to have the government decide which jobs are most important and what they're real value is. I'd be okay with not forcing people to pay the loan if they didn't exceed a certain threshold of earnings, but it would have to be much lower than $125,000.


>All I want is for the same principles that that went into PPP forgiveness for businesses to also apply to actual working people!

The PPP was created to mitigate the likely occurrence of severe economic deterioration. It's not meant to be a sustainable program and it's first purpose was to ensure that a critical number of people didn't lose their jobs (most of which were low and middle income) and destabilize the entire country. Student loans are meant to be a long-term, sustainable solution. For the reasons I've outlined, I don't think it would be beneficial to the country, especially for low income households, to be robbed a crucial public funds to subsidize society's highest earners.",1688162519,1,politics,2023-06,0.40336934

After an unquestionable loss to Biden in the 2020 election, Donald Trump bought into a wild and baseless conspiracy theory pushed by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell that he could be reinstated as president before the next election. This revelation comes in ABC News’ Jonathan Karl’s upcoming book on the former president, Tired of Winning: Trump and the End of the Grand Old Party.

Lindell was spreading a baseless theory that Trump would be back in power by Aug. 13, 2021, vowing that he had alleged terrabytes of “evidence” proving a grand conspiracy that Chinese hackers perpetuated widespread vote tampering. Needless to say, the evidence never surfaced, and Biden still occupies the White House.

Though, I will say, I consider Baptists in Alabama pretty specific - I mean I'm atheist and Jewish and in Israel there are Jewish people that I strongly disagree with (some of whom are very religious...) There are also muslims (~20%) and Christians. And Jewish people themselves have of course large variety of opinions, it is sort of part of Jewish culture to question things - the saying is if you have 2 jews in the room you'll have at least 3 opinions. There are also Jews who were expelled from Europe, Jews who were expelled from other Arab countries, Jews who were expelled from Africa, Jews who were expelled from Russia and so on.. So I feel it is disingenuous to characterize it as homogenous as ""Baptists in Alabama.""

When you ask ""how is it ok for 'Jews' to forcefully take land from the Palestinians"" I assume you aren't talking about the West Bank. If you are, I personally don't think it is ok and I'm not a fan of the current Israeli government. 

If you are referring to 1948. At this point practically, most people in Israel were born there. Perhaps in 1948, you could have decided to make this state in California or Germany or wherever or just kill all the jews and be done with it - but that's not what happened and this is the hand that we are dealt. If you decide to now ""change your mind"" and by Western force or I guess more fun through China/Russia/Iran ""delete"" Israel and allow ""Palestine from the River to the Sea"" that means Jews within Israel will be genocid-ed in favor of another Islamic state with Sharia law. We got a pretty good peak of how that would go on Oct 7th... 

You can visit the askhistorians subreddit for how Israel was formed in 1948... But I would say that Jews are basically natives in this land - and were expelled as ""rulers"" from it a long time ago.. But they've maintained a presence. Jews have a history of being discriminated against from both sides of the spectrum.

I reject that framing. I want to switch to a market-based system that has more competition and innovation to bring down costs and get better results, and reduce the tremendous inefficiency that the government administrative process has. Ones that suck will not make a profit and fail, yes, but that isn't the end goal for me.

And I'm fine with infrastructure and having public education, but I would like more support for charter schools and granting tax credits or vouchers to people, especially low-income ones, so we can shift to promoting competition in education to improve performance, which I agree has become absolutely terrible in the last few decades (really, ever since the late 70's when we created the Department of Education). I'd like to privatize social security to mirror something similar to what they have in Sweden as well, for example.

So yeah, like I said, I'd ideally like to offset tax cuts with real reforms and reductions in the size of our bloated government. It isn't just ""fuck you, got mine"", either. I think those reforms would work **better** than the current system.",1709918538,1,politics,2024-03,0.2855005

>In March 2018, thousands of school-aged children organized
the “March for Our Lives,” where they demanded stricter gun
control across the United States in the aftermath of the Parkland
school shooting.1 Responding to the event, **retired United States
Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens argued that while the
students’ message was commendable, it simply did not go far
enough.2 “They should demand a repeal of the Second
Amendment,**” he stated flatly.3 In support of his position, Justice
Stevens reiterated the essence of his dissenting opinion in the
pivotal Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller—**that the
Second Amendment does not protect an individual’s right to keep
and bear firearms**

A Supreme Court Justice was calling for the REPEAL of an amendment in regards to what was an Anti-Gun rally. He doesn't have that power, that's the legislative branch.

He also states it's not an individual right. Why is he so concerned about it being repealed?

Your reaction is an emotional 1. Less guns wont solve anything but it will make you feel better in some twisted way that schools are being bombed instead of shot up right?


But keep begging big brother to take away your rights and see what happens. No one will say ""I told you so"" history is already full of warnings",1725611721,-2,politics,2024-09,0.29039988

 The Constitution and the law generally supersede the responsibilities of the U.S. Secret Service to the individuals they protect, meaning that their duty to uphold the law and the Constitution takes precedence over their protective duties.


### **Key Points Regarding Their Duties:**


1. **Oath to the Constitution**:
   - Secret Service agents, like all federal officers, take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. This means their ultimate loyalty is to the Constitution, not to any individual.


2. **Legal Accountability**:
   - If a VIP they are protecting commits a crime, the Secret Service is still bound by the law. They are not obligated to assist in or cover up illegal activities. In cases where a protected individual is involved in criminal activity, the Secret Service must cooperate with the appropriate law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI or Department of Justice.


3. **National Security and Constitutional Risks**:
   - If a protected individual poses a risk to national security or violates constitutional principles, the Secret Service has a duty to report and address such threats. While their primary role is protective, they are also obligated to ensure that their actions, and the actions of those they protect, do not endanger the nation or violate the Constitution.


4. **Balancing Protection with Legal Duties**:
   - The Secret Service faces a unique challenge in balancing the protection of high-ranking officials with the need to uphold the law. For instance, if a protected person is under investigation for a crime, the Secret Service would continue to provide protection but also coordinate with law enforcement to ensure that justice is served.


### **Scenarios Involving Crimes or Constitutional Risks**:


- **If a VIP Commits a Crime**:
   - The Secret Service would continue to protect the individual to ensure their safety but would also report the crime to the appropriate authorities. The law enforcement process would proceed, with the Secret Service providing protection even during legal proceedings.


- **If a VIP Endangers National Security**:
   - In situations where a protected individual is believed to be endangering national security, the Secret Service is required to take appropriate action to neutralize the threat. This could involve reporting the individual to other agencies responsible for national security and cooperating in investigations.


- **If Constitutional Principles are Violated**:
   - The Secret Service must ensure that their actions, and the actions of those they protect, do not violate constitutional principles. If a conflict arises between their protective duties and constitutional violations, the Constitution takes precedence, and they must act in accordance with the law.


In summary, while the Secret Service's primary mission is protection, their duty to uphold the Constitution and the law supersedes their responsibility to any individual. They must balance protection with legal obligations, and in cases of criminal activity or threats to national security, they are required to cooperate with appropriate authorities to ensure justice and the protection of constitutional principles.",1727454831,1,politics,2024-09,0.077668175

Not a legitimate one. They typically will change the subject to blm or other things they hate about the left so they don’t have to say it’s bad. There are some that actually make an attempt to downplay and dismiss what happened.

> Trump’s legal team did gather alternate electors as part of the process to challenge the results.   IE, they were required on the off chance that enough evidence was found to prove Trump actually won.  Not some nefarious plot.

I ask this sincerely and non-rhetorically, if enough evidence was found that trump actually won, why did there need to be alternate electors? Why wouldn’t the current ones at the time be able to certify the results?

The intent was for these alternate electors to change the outcome of the election regardless of evidence, this required certifying illegitimate results.
